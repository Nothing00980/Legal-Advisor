COMMENTS.—
The only allegation relating to section 341 was that accused stood in front of victim in
such a manner that she had to move backward. From such act alone it cannot be said
that he "wrongfully restrained" her within the meaning of section 339, IPC, 1860 to
make him liable under section 341, IPC, 1860.946. Accused, appellant caught the victim
from behind, pushed her on ground, removed her panty and made an attempt to rape.
Evidence of victim was found consistent. She specifically stated that upon getting
opportunity she kicked in testicles of accused and escaped from place of occurrence.
Conviction under section 341 and section 511 of 376 was upheld.947. Accused with 2–
3 other persons restricted the deceased on way and an axe blow was given by first
accused on the head of the deceased and that was resisted by patting hands ahead.
Consequent to the blow aforesaid he received an injury near his ear. A lathi blow then
was given by second accused on the head of the deceased, consequent to which he fell
down and then he was severely beaten by the accused. Deceased succumbed to the
injuries sustained. Conviction under sections 302 and 341 was upheld.948.
