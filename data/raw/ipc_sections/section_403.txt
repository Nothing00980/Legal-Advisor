Punishment for robbery.
Whoever commits robbery shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term
which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and, if the robbery be
committed on the highway between sunset and sunrise, the imprisonment may be
extended to fourteen years.
COMMENT—
This section no doubt allows the Court discretion as regards the minimum punishment
to be awarded, but when the offence is attended with circumstances which would
make the attempt to commit it punishable with the minimum sentence of seven years,
it would not be a proper exercise of discretion to award a lesser sentence when the
offence has been accomplished.166. A person who has been convicted of robbery
under this section need not be convicted of theft.167. Where the wholly of the robbed
property was not recovered from the persons accused, it was held that the proper
section to convict was section 411.168.
[s 392.1] Essential ingredients for punishment under Section 392.—
Essential ingredients for punishment under section 392 are:
(1) The accused committed theft;
(2) he voluntarily caused or attempted to cause:
(i) death, hurt or wrongful restraint,
(ii) fear of instant death, hurt or wrongful restraint;
(3) he did either act for the end:
(i) of committing theft,
(ii) while committing theft,
(iii) in carrying away or in the attempt to carry away property obtained by
theft.169.
Where section 397 also applies, (robbery accompanied by attempt to cause death or
grievous hurt) the punishment has to be for a period not less than seven years. The
Supreme Court has held that this minimum prescribed sentence cannot be by-passed
by resorting to plea bargaining.170. Section 392 itself provides that when robbery is
committed on a highway and between sunset and sunrise, deterrent punishment is
called for.171.
[s 392.2] CASES.—
In a case of alleged dacoity and murder, seven accused persons were convicted under
section 396 as looted property was recovered from their possession within a very short
time after the offence. The evidence of an eye-witness showed that murder was
committed only by the three of the accused persons of whom one was given benefit of
doubt. It was held only the remaining two accused were liable to be punished under
sections 392 and 302 and other only under section 411.172. Where the accused was
alleged to have committed dacoity alongwith four other co-accused who were
acquitted, his conviction under section 395 was altered to one under section 392
(robbery).173. When articles recovered from accused were identified to be articles of
theft by complainant, the fact that watch recovered was not mentioned in FIR is not
sufficient to reject testimony of complainant. No explanation was offered by accused
as to how they came into possession of articles recovered. The Supreme Court held
that Recoveries proved sufficient to connect accused with crime.174.
[s 392.3] Bank Robbery.—
The identity of the accused was proved by fingerprint impressions available at the door
of the bank. The photographs of the fingerprints were to be proved by examining the
photographer. However, this lapse in the prosecution cannot result in acquittal of the
appellants. The evidence adduced by the prosecution must be scrutinized
independently of such lapses either in the investigation or by the prosecution or
otherwise. The result of the criminal trial would depend upon the level of investigation
or the conduct of the prosecution. Criminal trials should not be made casualty for such
lapses in the investigation or prosecution.175.
[s 392.4] Sentence.—
The offence was committed in a cool, calculated and gruesome manner. The accused
could have easily committed the robbery without taking away the life of the victim, if
robbery had been the motive. Keeping in mind the macabre nature of the crime, the
High Court of Madras ordered that the sentences imposed on the accused should run
consecutively and not concurrently.176.
