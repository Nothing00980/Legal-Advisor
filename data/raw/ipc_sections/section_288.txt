[s 285.1] Cases.—
A factory worker allegedly died due to rash and negligent act of occupier or manager. It
was argued that section 92 of Factories Act, 1948 prescribes punishment to occupier
or manager of factory for contravention of any of the provisions of Factories Act or any
rules made thereunder. It was held that there is nothing in Factories Act (Special Law)
which prescribes punishment for rash and negligent act of occupier or manager of
factory which resulted into the death of any worker or any other person. Hence,
offences under IPC, 1860 including section 285 will apply.86. Where a factory manager,
in breach of conditions in the licence kept naked fire in proximity of stores of turpentine
and vanish and the fire caused death of seven workers, the court found that he is guilty
under sections 285 and 304A IPC, 1860.87. The acts of accused in setting fire to the
Tobacco Stock inside the house after pouring petrol and further act of throwing petrol
on the deceased when he tried to pacify, cannot be held as either rash or negligent act
so as to attract the offence under section 285 of IPC, 1860.88.
