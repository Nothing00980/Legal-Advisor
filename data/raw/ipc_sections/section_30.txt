"Fraudulently.".
A person is said to do a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to defraud 1
but not otherwise.
COMMENT—
The intention with which an act is done is very important in determining whether the
act is done 'dishonestly' or 'fraudulently'.
1. 'Intent to defraud'.—The terms 'fraud' and 'defraud' are not defined in the Penal Code.
The word 'defraud' is of double meaning in the sense that it either may or may not imply
deprivation, and, as it is not defined, its meaning must be sought by a consideration of
the context in which the word 'fraudulently' is found.126.
Fraud is an act of deliberate deception with a design to secure something, which is
otherwise not due. Fraud and deception are synonymous.127.
To 'defraud' or do something fraudulently is not by itself made an offence under the
Penal Code, but various acts when done fraudulently (or fraudulently and dishonestly)
are made offences. These include:
(i) Fraudulent removal or concealment of property (sections 206, 421, 424)
(ii) Fraudulent claim to property to prevent seizure (section 207).
(iii) Fraudulent suffering or obtaining a decree (sections 208 and 210)
(iv) Fraudulent possession/delivery of counterfeit coin (sections 239, 240, 242 and
243).
(v) Fraudulent alteration/diminishing weight of coin (sections 246–253)
(vi) Fraudulent acts relating to stamps (sections 261–261)
(vii) Fraudulent use of false instruments/weight/measure (sections 264–266)
(viii) Cheating (sections 415–420)
(ix) Fraudulent prevention of debt being available to creditors (section 422).
(x) Fraudulent execution of deed of transfer containing false statement of
consideration (section 423).
(xi) Forgery making or executing a false document (sections 463–471 and 474)
(xii) Fraudulent cancellation/destruction of valuable security, etc. (section 477)
(xiii) Fraudulently going through marriage ceremony (section 496).
It follows therefore, that by merely alleging or showing that a person acted fraudulently,
it cannot be assumed that he committed an offence punishable under the Code or any
other law, unless that fraudulent act is specified to be an offence under the Code or
other law.128.
The expression 'defraud' involves two elements, namely, deceit and injury to the person
deceived. The injury may even comprise a non-economic or non-pecuniary loss. Even in
those rare cases where the benefit to the deceiver does not cause corresponding loss
to the deceived, the second condition is satisfied.129. The expression "intent to deceive"
is different from the expression "intent to defraud".130. "Intent to defraud" is established
only when the deception has as its aim some advantage or the likelihood of advantage
to the person who causes the deceit or some kind of injury or the possibility of injury to
another.131. Thus, where an expert deposing before a court as a defence witness was
asked to produce his credentials before the court and it appeared from the documents
produced that they were not genuine, it was held that as he acted under the orders of
the court and not voluntarily, it could not be said that his intention was to cause any
one to act to his disadvantage. In the circumstances, he did not act with "intent to
defraud". He was, therefore, held liable under sections 193 and 196 but not under
sections 465 and 471, IPC, 1860.132.
[s 25.1] 'Fraudulently'; 'dishonestly'.—
According to the Supreme Court "the word "defraud" includes an element of deceit.
Deceit is not an ingredient of the definition of the word "dishonestly" while it is an
important ingredient of the definition of the word "fraudulently". The former involves a
pecuniary or economic gain or loss while the latter by construction excludes that
element. Further, the juxtaposition of the two expressions "dishonestly" and
"fraudulently" used in the various sections of the Code indicate their close affinity and
therefore, the definition of one may give colour to the other. To illustrate, in the
definition of "dishonestly", wrongful gain or wrongful loss is the necessary ingredient.
Both need not exist, one would be enough. So too, if the expression "fraudulently" were
to be held to involve the element of injury to the person or persons deceived, it would
be reasonable to assume that the injury should be something other than pecuniary or
economic loss. Though almost always an advantage to one causes loss to another and
vice versa, it need not necessarily be so."133.
Where the accused, after the execution and registration of a document, which was not
required by law to be attested, added his name to the document as an attesting
witness, it was held that his act was neither fraudulent nor dishonest and the accused
was, therefore, not guilty of forgery.134. A person who is not a member of Scheduled
Caste or Scheduled Tribes obtains a false certificate with a view to gain undue
advantage to which he or she was not otherwise entitled to would amount to
commission of fraud135. Suppression of a material document would also amount to a
fraud on the court.136.
