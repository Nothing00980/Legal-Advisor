such prisoner is confined, shall be punished with 103.[imprisonment for life], or
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and

COMMENT—
Allowing escape to prisoners.—This section and section 225A provide for one kind of
offence. In both sections the public servant who has the custody of the prisoner is
punished if he voluntarily allows such prisoner to escape. In this section the prisoner
must be a State prisoner or a prisoner of war; under section 225A the prisoner may be
an ordinary criminal. The offence under this section is thus, an aggravated form of the
offence than under section 225A.
1. 'State prisoner' is one whose confinement is necessary in order to preserve the
security of India from foreign hostility or from internal commotion, and who has been
confined by the order of the Government of India.104.
2. 'Prisoner of war' is one who in war is taken in arms. Those who are not in arms, or
who being in arms submit and surrender themselves, are not to be slain but to be made
prisoners. But it seems those only are prisoners of war who are taken in arms.105.
103. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, section 117 and Sch., for "transportation for life" (w.e.f. 1 January
1956).
104. Beng Reg III of 1818; Bom Reg VIII of 1818; Mad Reg II of 1819.
