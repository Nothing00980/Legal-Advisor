Stolen property.
Property, the possession whereof has been transferred by theft, or by extortion, or by
robbery, and property which has been criminally misappropriated or in respect of
which 441.[***] criminal breach of trust has been committed, is designated as "stolen
property", 442.[whether the transfer has been made, or the misappropriation or breach
of trust has been committed, within or without 443.[India]]. But, if such property
subsequently comes into the possession of a person legally entitled to the possession
thereof, it then ceases to be stolen property.
