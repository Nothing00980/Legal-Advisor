Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the
body.
The right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable
apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the
offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it continues as long as
such apprehension of danger to the body continues.
COMMENT.â€”
This section indicates when the right of private defence of the body commences and
till what time it continues. The right commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension
of danger to the body arises from an attempt, or threat, or commit the offence,
although the offence may not have been committed, but not until that there is that
reasonable apprehension. The right lasts so long as the reasonable apprehension of
the danger to the body continues.484. It commences and continues as long as danger
to body lasts. The extent to which the exercise of the right will be justified will depend
not on the actual danger but on whether there was reasonable apprehension of such
danger. There must be an attempt or threat and consequent thereon an apprehension
of danger; but it is not a mere idle threat, or every apprehension of a rash or timid mind,
that will justify the exercise of the right. Reasonable ground for the apprehension is
requisite. Suppose the threat to proceed from a woman or child and to be addressed to
a strong man, in such a case there could hardly be a reasonable apprehension. Present
and imminent danger seems to be meant.485. The person exercising a right of private
defence must consider whether the threat to his person or his property is real and
immediate. If he reaches the conclusion reasonably that the threat is immediate and
real, he is entitled to exercise his right. In the exercise of his right, he must use force
necessary for the purpose and he must stop using the force as soon as the threat has
disappeared. So long as the threat lasts and the right of private defence can be
legitimately exercised; if the danger is continuing, the right is there; if the danger or the
apprehension about it has ceased to exist there is no longer the right of private
defence.486. Right commences, as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the
body arises from an attempt, or threat, or commit the offence, although the offence
may not have been committed but not until that there is that reasonable apprehension.
The right lasts so long as the reasonable apprehension of the danger to the body
continues.487. There is no right to inflict punishment on the wrong-doer for his past act
after the apprehension has ceased to exist. The right of defence ends with the
necessity for it. So where the deceased was fleeing for his life, there was no
justification to shoot him down. This would be a sheer case of murder and nothing
else.488. Where the testimony of the independent witness showed that the accused
chased one of the deceased who fled away from the scene of occurrence and killed
him, they could not be said to have right of private defence as regards the killing of
such deceased.489. Though the nature of apprehension depends upon the nature of
weapon intended to be used or used, it cannot be said that as the complainant's party
had only used lathis, the accused was not justified in using his spear especially when a
blow with a lathi was aimed at a vulnerable part like the head.490.
