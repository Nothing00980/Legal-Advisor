Joining or continuing in unlawful assembly, knowing it has been
commanded to disperse.

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two
years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT—
Joining or continuing with unlawful assembly.—
This section is connected with section 151, infra. Section 188 of IPC, 1860 provides for
the disobedience of any lawful order promulgated by a public servant. Sections 145
and 151 deal with special cases as the disobedience may cause serious breach of the
peace. As to the powers of the police to disperse an unlawful assembly, see section
129, Criminal Procedure Code.
[s 145.1] CASES.—
Where an assembly did not by its own conduct become an unlawful assembly by
developing common object within the meaning of section 141, IPC, 1860, its members
could not be convicted under section 145, IPC, by merely joining or continuing as its
members.52. It may, however, be added here that members of such an assembly, even
though not unlawful, could be prosecuted under section 151, IPC, if the order of
dispersal had been lawfully given in the bona fide exercise of police powers under
section 129, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973), with a view to preventing
a breach of the peace.53.
