Fractions of terms of punishment.
In calculating fractions of terms of punishment, 177.[imprisonment] for life shall be
reckoned as equivalent to 178.[imprisonment] for twenty years.
COMMENT—
Section 57 of the IPC, 1860 does not in any way limit the punishment of imprisonment
for life to a term of 20 years. Section 57 is only for calculating fractions of terms of
punishment and provides that imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to
imprisonment for 20 years. The object and purpose of section 57 will be clear by simply
referring to sections 65, 116, 119, 129 and 511 of the IPC, 1860.179. The accused has
thus no right to be released after a period of 20 years. The remissions granted under
the rules made under the Prison Act or under the Jail Manual are merely administrative
orders of the appropriate Government and fall exclusively within the discretion of the
Government under section 401 (now section 432) Cr PC, 1973. In the case of a prisoner
who is convicted in one State but transferred to the jail of another State to serve out the
sentence, the appropriate Government to grant remission would be the Government of
the State where the accused was convicted and not that of the transferee
Government.180.
[s 57.1] Life imprisonment.—
Life imprisonment means imprisonment for the whole of a convict's natural life. It does
not automatically expire on his serving sentence of 14 years or 20 years, unless, of
course, the sentence is remitted or commuted by the Government in accordance with
the law181. The Court said that life imprisonment means imprisonment for the whole of
the remaining period of the convict's life. The fact that the West Bengal Correctional
Services Act 1992, equates life imprisonment with imprisonment for 20 years does not
entitle the convict to automatic release on expiry of such term of imprisonment
including remission.182.
[s 57.2] Punishment for attempt Under Section 511 when the offence
attempted is punishable with Life imprisonment.—
Section 57 of the IPC, 1860 provides that in calculating fractions of terms of
punishment, imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for
20 years. In view of this, for the offence of attempt to commit rape punishable under
section 376(2)(a) read with section 511 maximum sentence would be rigorous
imprisonment for ten years.183.
