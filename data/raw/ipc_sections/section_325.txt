Voluntarily causing grievous hurt.
Whoever voluntarily causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or knows
himself to be likely to cause is grievous hurt, and if the hurt which he causes is
grievous hurt, is said "voluntarily to cause grievous hurt."
Explanation.—A person is not said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt except when he
both causes grievous hurt and intends or knows himself to be likely to cause grievous
hurt. But he is said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt, if intending or knowing himself
to be likely to cause grievous hurt of one kind, he actually causes grievous hurt of
another kind.
