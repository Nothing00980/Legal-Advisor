Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous
hurt, done by consent.
Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not
known by the doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason
of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person,
above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, whether express or implied, to
suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the doer to be
likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm.
ILLUSTRATION
A and Z agrees to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the
consent of each to suffer any harm which, in the course of such fencing, may be
caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.
COMMENT.—
Consent.—This section protects a person who causes injury to another person above
18 years of age who has given his consent by doing an act not intended and not known
to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt. It appears to proceed upon the maxim
volenti non fit injuria. He who consents suffers no injury. This rule is founded upon two
very simple propositions: (1) that every person is the best judge of his own interest and
(2) that no man will consent to what he thinks hurtful to himself. Every man is free to
inflict any suffering or damage he chooses on his own person and property; and if,
instead of doing this himself, he consents to its being done by another, the doer
commits no offence. A man may give away his property, and so another who takes it by
his permission does not commit theft. He may inflict self-torture or he may consent to
suffer torture at the hands of another.
The section does not permit a man to give his consent to anything intended, or known
to be likely to cause his own death or grievous hurt.
[s 87.1] Sado-masochistic desires.—
In the absence of a good reason, the victim's consent is no defence and the
satisfaction of sado-masochistic desires does not constitute such a good reason. A
group of sado-masochistics participated in consensual acts of violence against each
other for sexual gratification. They were charged with various offences. They were
convicted for causing harm to one member. It is not in public interest that a person
should wound or cause actual bodily harm to another for no good reason and without
such a reason the victim's consent afforded no defence.210.
[s 87.2] Injection of heroin on request resulting in death.—
The accused appealed against a sentence of five years' imprisonment for
manslaughter. The deceased, visited him, at his flat. He had previously drunk a
significant quantity of alcohol. He took some heroin and demanded more. At his
request the accused injected him with more heroin, resulting in his death. The accused
contended that weight should have been given to his admission of responsibility and
his guilty plea, the fact that the deceased had insisted upon more heroin, that there was
no commercial motive involved in the supply and that he had co-operated in naming the
supplier of the heroin.
It was held that it was necessary to take into consideration accused's co-operation in
naming the supplier of the heroin and other mitigating factors. The sentence for
manslaughter was reduced to three years' imprisonment and the sentence for
supplying a Class A drug, from three years' imprisonment to two years.211.
Sections 87 and 88 of the IPC, 1860 do not come into play in the cases where interest
of the Society is involved.212.
