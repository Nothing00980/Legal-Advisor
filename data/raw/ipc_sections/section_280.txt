Fouling water of public spring or reservoir.
Whoever voluntarily corrupts or fouls the water of any public spring or reservoir, so as
to render it less fit for the purpose for which it is ordinarily used, shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months,
or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.
COMMENT.—
The water of a public spring or reservoir belongs to every member of the public in
common, and if a person voluntarily fouls it he commits a public nuisance.
[s 277.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires—
(1) voluntary corruption or fouling of water;
(2) the water must be of a public spring or reservoir; and
(3) the water must be rendered less fit for the purpose for which it is ordinarily
used.
As a general rule, a place is a public place if people are allowed access to it, though
they may have no legal right to it.
[s 277.2] Section 277 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act,
1974.—
The contention that the provisions contained in the Water Act take away the effect of
section 277 cannot readily be assumed especially when there is nothing in the Water
Act to hold that the provisions therein are intended to nullify section 277 from the Penal
Code. The argument that the non-obstante clause in section 60 has the effect of
repealing section 277 of IPC, 1860, also is unsustainable. The non-obstante clause in
section 60 cannot be assumed to supersede or extinguish such provisions in the
General Law. If the non-obstante clause in section 60 was intended to exclude or nullify
section 277 of IPC, 1860, then there would have been strong indication available in the
specific provision itself.28.
