COMMENT.—
The provisions of section 354 IPC, 1860 has been enacted to safeguard public morality
and decent behaviour. Therefore, if any person uses criminal force upon any woman
with the intention or knowledge that the woman's modesty will be outraged, he is to be
punished. In Vishaka v State of Rajasthan,1001. and Apparel Export Promotion Council v
AK Chopra,1002. the Supreme Court held that the offence relating to modesty of woman
cannot be treated as trivial. In order to constitute the offence under section 354, IPC,
1860 mere knowledge that the modesty of a woman is likely to be outraged is sufficient
without any deliberate intention of such outrage alone for its object. There is no
abstract conception of modesty that can apply to all cases. A careful approach has to
be adopted by the Court while dealing with a case alleging outrage of modesty.
The essential ingredients of the offence under section 354, IPC, 1860 are as under:
(1) That the person assaulted must be a woman.
(2) Accused must have used criminal force on her intending thereby to outrage her
modesty.
(3) What constitutes an outrage to female modesty is nowhere defined—The
essence of a woman's modesty is her sex.
(4) Act of pulling a woman, removing her dress coupled with a request for sexual
intercourse, as such would be an outrage to the modesty of a woman.
(5) Knowledge, that modesty is likely to be outraged, is sufficient to constitute the
offence without any deliberate intention of having such outrage alone for its
object.1003.
Intention is not the sole criterion of the offence punishable under section 354, IPC,
1860 and it can be committed by a person assaulting or using criminal force to any
woman, if he knows that by such act the modesty of the woman is likely to be affected.
Knowledge and intention are essentially things of the mind and cannot be
demonstrated like physical objects. The existence of intention or knowledge has to be
culled out from various circumstances in which and upon whom the alleged offence is
alleged to have been committed.1004. Even though it is true that assault or criminal
force to woman is one of the essential pre-conditions for applicability of section 354
IPC, 1860 but the same has to be with an intent to outrage her modesty or knowing it to
be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty. Neither the use of criminal force
alone nor act of outraging the modesty alone is sufficient to attract an offence under
section 354 IPC, 1860.1005.
[s 354.1] Modesty.—Meaning.—
The essence of a woman's modesty is her sex. The culpable intention of the accused is
the crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is
not always decisive. Modesty is an attribute associated with female human beings as a
class. It is virtue which attaches to a family owing to her sex. The ultimate test for
ascertaining whether the modesty of a woman has been outraged, assaulted or
insulted is that the action of the offender should be such that it may be perceived as
one which is capable of shocking the sense of decency of a woman. A person slapping
on the posterior of a woman in full public glare would amount to outraging her modesty
for it was not only an affront to the normal sense of feminine decency but also an
affront to the dignity of the lady. The word "modesty" is not to be interpreted with
reference to the particular victim of the act, but as an attribute associated with female
human beings as a class. It is a virtue which attaches to a female on account of her
sex.1006. In State of Punjab v Major Singh,1007., a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme
Court considered the question — Whether modesty of a female child of seven and half
months can also be outraged. The majority view was in the affirmative. Bachawat, J, on
behalf of majority, opined as:
The offence punishable u/s. 354 is an assault on or use of criminal force to a woman with
the intention of outraging her modesty or with the knowledge of the likelihood of doing so.
The Code does not define 'modesty'. What then is a woman's modesty? … The essence of a
woman's modesty is her sex. The modesty of an adult female is written large on her body.
Young or old, intelligent or imbecile, awake or sleeping, the woman possesses a modesty
capable of being outraged. Whoever uses criminal force to her with intent to outrage her
modesty commits an offence punishable u/s. 354. The culpable intention of the accused is
the crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is not
always decisive, as, for example, when the accused with a corrupt mind stealthily touches
the flesh of a sleeping woman. She may be an idiot, she may be under the spell of
anaesthesia, she may be sleeping, she may be unable to appreciate the significance of the
act; nevertheless, the offender is punishable under the section.1008.
An indecent assault upon a woman is punished under this section. Rape is punished
under section 376; but the offence under this section is of less gravity than rape.1009.
Knowledge that modesty is likely to be outraged has been held to be sufficient to
constitute the offence without any deliberate intention to outrage modesty. In this case
the victim woman was brought into a room under false pretexts, the room was locked
from outside, inside she was forced to drink, photographs taken in naked state and
raped. All the participants were held to be guilty of outraging her modesty.1010. A
person who is guilty of attempting rape cannot be allowed to escape with the lesser
penalty of this section. Where the accused walked into the room where a female child
of seven and a half months was sleeping and committed an indecent assault on the
child, he was held to have committed an offence under this section as he had outraged
and intended to outrage whatever modesty the little victim was capable of.1011. Their
Lordships of the House of Lords have pointed out that a person is guilty of indecent
assault if he intentionally assaults the victim and intends to commit not just an assault
but an indecent assault, i.e., an assault which right-minded persons would think is
indecent. Accordingly, any evidence explaining the defendant's conduct, whether an
admission by him or otherwise, is admissible to establish whether he intended to
commit an indecent assault. In this case,1012. a 26-year-old shop assistant pulled a 12-
year-old girl visitor to the shop across his knees and smacked her with his hand 12
times on her bottom outside her shorts for no apparent reason. On being asked he
explained his weakness as "buttock fetish". But for this admission there was nothing to
convert the assault (to which he confessed) into an indecent one. His explanation to
his secret motive was held to be relevant to hold him guilty of indecent assault.
Moreover, according to section 10, IPC, 1860 a woman denotes a female human being
of any age. Where the woman is a consenting party there cannot be any outraging of
modesty.1013. Unless culpable intention is proved mere touching the belly of a female
in a public bus cannot be called a deliberate act of outraging the modesty of a female
within the meaning of this section. In the circumstances of the case the act of the
accused was held to be accidental and not intentional.1014. Where the accused caught
hold of a married woman and tried to open the string of her salwar with a view to
committing rape on her but being hit by the woman with a kulhari fled away, it was held
that he could not be convicted under section 376 read with section 511 IPC, 1860 as
his action did not show a determination to have sexual intercourse at all events and in
spite of resistance. The conviction of the accused was accordingly changed to one
under section 354, IPC, 1860.1015.
Where the allegation was, while the victim was returning from home, the accused came
from behind and pressed her breast, the Court convicted him under section 354 IPC,
1860.1016. The accused came from behind her and caught hold of her and laid her
down on the cot and sat on her chest. She shouted and after that the accused left her
house. After hearing her shouts, her cousin mother-in-law came there. High Court
rejected the defence of false implication and convicted the accused under section 354,
IPC, 1860.1017. Where a married woman alleged that the two accused persons had
dragged her in her own home and raped her one after the other and the medical
evidence showed that though there were traces of semen on her clothes, there were
none on the clothes of the accused persons, the Court opined that the case was not
made out; the presence of semen on the clothes of a married woman is not unusual
and therefore, the accused could have been prosecuted only for outraging the modesty
of a woman.1018.
Some labourers, including a woman, were taken to a police station for some work.
When they demanded wages, they were beaten up. The woman was stripped bare and
thrashed. The matter came before the Supreme Court in a writ petition under Article 32
of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the offence under section 354, IPC,
1860 was established in reference to the woman and awarded compensation to be
recovered from the salary of the guilty officers.1019. The offence was held to have been
made out where a senior police officer slapped the posterior of the prosecutrix in the
midst of guests in a party. The accused must have been fully aware that such an act
would embarrass her and outrage her modesty. She made hue and cry immediately.
Her conduct did not suggest that she was stage-managing things to malign the
accused. The Court observed such behaviour was not expected from a high-ranked
police officer. His conviction for the offence under the section was maintained by the
Supreme Court.1020.
[s 354.2] Parading a naked tribal woman.—
In a case of parading of a naked tribal woman after disrobing her on the village road in
broad daylight by appellants, the Supreme Court held that the dishonour of the victim
called for harsher punishment.1021.
[s 354.3] Outraging modesty or Rape.—
Dividing line between attempt to commit rape and indecent assault is not only thin but
also is practically invisible. Evidence of informant that when she went to the house of
accused, she found that the victim was sleeping on the floor and accused was lying on
her. Accused removed her nicker with a view to commit sexual intercourse. Medical
evidence does not indicate as to whether accused has tried to force his penis inside
the private part of girl but could not succeed. Offence committed by accused did not
amount to attempt to commit rape punishable under section 376 read with section 511
of IPC, 1860 but was one under section 354.1022. Though there was ample evidence
that the victim was disrobed by the accused and thus the accused, outraged her
modesty there was no evidence of rape. Conviction under section 376 was altered to
section 354.1023. But in State of UP v Rajit Ram1024. the Supreme Court set aside a
judgment by which a conviction under section 376 was altered to section 354 and
remitted the case back to trial court. The accused in another case had forcibly laid the
prosecutrix on the bed and broken her pyjama's string but made no attempt to undress
himself and when the prosecutrix pushed him away, he did not make efforts to grab her
again. It was held that it was not an attempt to rape but only outraging of the modesty
of a woman and conviction under section 354 was proper.1025. But in Ram Mehar v
State of Haryana,1026. the accused caught hold of the prosecutrix, lifted her and then
took her to a bajra field where, he pinned her down and tried to open her salwar but
could not do so as the prosecutrix had injured him by giving a sickle blow. The accused
failed to give his blood sample with the result it could be presumed that his innocence
was doubtful. Ocular evidence of the prosecutrix was also corroborated by other
evidence. It was held that conviction of the accused under sections 354, 376/511 was
proper. The accused caught the victim from behind, pushed her on ground, removed her
panty and attempted rape. Upon getting opportunity she kicked him in testicles and
escaped from place of occurrence. The accused was convicted under section 511 read
with section 376.1027.
[s 354.4] Punishment enhanced by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 (Act
13 of 2013).—
By the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 while no change has been made in the
definition of the offence, the punishment for the offence prescribed in this section has
been changed by providing a minimum sentence of one year and a maximum sentence
of five years.
[s 354.5] CASES.—
Where the allegation was that the Principal of a school misbehaved with the girl
student, the High Court declined to quash the FIR, though he was exonerated in
Departmental proceedings.1028. Where the prosecutrix did not state specifically about
the act, but has loosely described as "fondling", the Supreme Court altered the
conviction from section 376 to section 354.1029. Victim, a deaf and dumb girl aged 13
years was lured by the accused from her house to a distant place. When family of
victim reached place, the accused fled away leaving victim who was weeping. Her
clothes were soiled with mud and accused concealed it. Accused was liable to be
convicted under section 354.1030. Where the accused touched the hand of the blind
prosecutrix, removed the quilt with which she was covering herself and put his hand in
her 'midi', conviction of the accused for attempt to commit rape was set aside but
conviction under sections 354, 457 and 506 was confirmed.1031.
Where the accused forcibly laid the prosecutrix on bed and cut the string of her pyjama
and tore her underwear but did not undress himself, the offence fell under section 354
and the offence of attempt to commit rape was not made out.1032.
Where the accused persons caught hold of a woman and removed the 'saree' from her
person but ran away on seeing someone approaching, their act attracted section 354
and not sections 375/511. Their conviction under sections 376/511 read with section
34 was altered to one under sections 354/34.1033.
Sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment.
[s 354.6] Compounding.—
Where the accused and respondent No. 2 had entered into a compromise and,
accordingly, she had filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court during the pendency of
appeal. Supreme Court allowed to compound the offences under sections 354 and 506
IPC, 1860.1034.
[s 354.7] Jurisdiction.—
The petitioners were charged with the offence of kidnapping and outraging the
modesty of the victim girl. She was taken to different places by train. In the course of
the journeys she was subjected to outraging. It was held that the Courts of the other
place would have jurisdiction to try the offender for both the offences.1035. The
accused held the arms of the prosecutrix with one hand and put the other hand on her
breasts. This was held to be an offence under section 354.1036.
[s 354.8] Sentencing.—
The Court must not only keep in view the rights of the victim of the crime but also the
society at large while considering the imposition of an appropriate punishment.1037.
[s 354.9] Benefit of Probation.—
As the appellant has committed a heinous crime and with the social condition
prevailing in the society, the modesty of a woman has to be strongly guarded and as
the appellant behaved like a roadside romeo, the Supreme Court held that it is not a fit
case where the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 should be given to the
appellant.1038.

penetration was not sufficient to absolve him of the offence of attempt to commit rape. It was
not a case of mere assault under section 354. Kuthu v State of MP, 1998 Cr LJ 960 (MP), the
accused took the prosecutrix by deception to a lonely place and cruelly pushed a bunch of
leaves into her mouth. They untied her undergarments to satisfy their lust. Conviction proper,
four months RI not interfered with. Shivraj Chandrappa Yadav v State, 1998 Cr LJ 3168 , the
