Using evidence known to be false.
Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to use as true or genuine evidence any evidence
which he knows to be false or fabricated, shall be punished in the same manner as if
he gave or fabricated false evidence.
COMMENT.â€”
This section applies to those who make use of such evidence as is made punishable by
sections 193, 194 and 195. It must be read with sections 191 and 192, and can only
apply to the use of evidence which was false evidence within the meaning of section
191, or fabricated evidence within the definition laid down in section 192.118. Where an
expert witness deposing on behalf of the defence claimed to be a diploma holder in
criminology from the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London and it was
found that the said claim was totally false and the diploma produced by him was a
forged document, it was held he committed an offence in relation to Court proceedings
under sections 193 and 196, IPC, 1860, and as such a Court complaint under section
195 (1)(b)(i), Cr PC, 1973, was necessary to prosecute him.119.
The word 'corruptly' in this section means something different from "dishonestly" or
"fraudulently". Although the user may not be dishonest or fraudulent, it may
nevertheless be corrupt, if the user is designed to corrupt or prevent the course of
justice. A person who files rent receipts alleged to have been granted by one of the
landlords, who actually signs the receipts to support a false case of a tenancy under
the landlord, does not commit an offence under section 471, but is guilty of corruptly
using as true or genuine evidence which he knows to be false within the meaning of
this section.120.
