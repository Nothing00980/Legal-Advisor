Abettor present when offence is committed.

present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in consequence of
the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or
offence.
COMMENTS.—
This section:
is only brought into operation when circumstances amounting to abetment of a particular
crime have first been proved, and then the presence of the accused at the commission of
that crime is proved in addition … Section 114 deals with the case, where there has been the
crime of abetment, but where also there has been actual commission of the crime abetted
and the abettor has been present thereat, and the way in which it deals with such a case is
this. Instead of the crime being still abetment with circumstances of aggravation, the crime
becomes the very crime abetted. The section is evidently not punitory. Because
participation de facto. … may sometimes be obscure in detail, it is established by the
presumption Juris et de jure that actual presence plus prior abetment can mean nothing else
but participation. The presumption raised by s. 114 brings the case within the ambit of s.
34.97.
The meaning of this section is that if the nature of the act done constitutes abetment,
then, if present, the abettor is to be deemed to have committed the offence, though in
point of fact another actually committed it. The abetment must be complete apart from
the mere presence of the abettor.98. The words "who if absent would be liable to be
punished as an abettor" clearly show that abetment must be one prior to the
commission of the offence and complete by itself.99. Where, for instance, a blow is
struck by A, in the presence of, and by the order of, B, both are principals in the
transaction. If A instigates B to murder, he commits abetment; if absent, he is
punishable as an abettor, and if the offence is committed, then under section 109; if
present, he is by this section deemed to have committed the offence and is punishable
as a principal. This section applies to cases where a person abets the commission of
the offence sometime before at a different place and also remains present at the time
the offence is committed.100. But where a person is charged with abetment under this
section for aiding in the Commission of an offence, e.g., section 300 IPC, 1860 and the
person charged as the principal offender is acquitted on the ground that he had not
committed the offence in question, no further question arises regarding abettor's
liability.101.
Section 114 is not applicable in every case in which the abettor is present at the
commission of the offence abetted. While section 109 is a section dealing generally
with abetment, section 114 applies to those cases only in which not only is the abettor
present at the time of the commission of the offence but abetment has been
committed prior to and independently of his presence.102.
[s 114.1] Sections 34 and 114.—
The distinction between sections 34 and 114 is a very fine one. According to section
34, where a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common
intention of all, each of them is liable as if it were done by himself alone; so that if two
or more persons are present, aiding and abetting in the commission of a murder each
will be tried and convicted as a principal, though it might not be proved which of them
actually committed the act. Section 114 refers to the case where a person by abetment,
previous to the commission of the act, renders himself liable as an abettor, is present
when the act is committed, but takes no active part in the doing of it.103. A mere
direction from one person to another and the carrying out of that direction by the other
may be only instigation of the latter's act and may not be a case of a joint act falling
under section 34.104. Accused provided an axe to his son who assaulted the victim
leading to his death. It was not a pre-meditated action on the part of main accused and
appellant supplied axe instantaneously without considering its pros and cons.
Conviction of appellant on charge of abetment (section 114) is not maintainable.105.
1. 'Present'.—It is not necessary that the party should be actually present, an ear or eye
witness of the transaction; he is, in construction of law, present, aiding and abetting, if,
with the intention of giving assistance, he be near enough to afford it, should occasion
arise. A conspirator, who, while his friends enter into a house and loot it, stands and
watches outside in pursuance of the common design, does not escape liability under
the section.106. Where, therefore, a person watched at the door of a house while a
murder was being committed inside he would be guilty of murder.107.
[s 114.2] Section 376 read with Section 114.—
In order to bring home such conviction under section 376, IPC, 1860 read with section
114, IPC, 1860 there must be evidence on record to show: (a) that there was abetment
of rape to be committed; (b) that the abettors have factually abetted the commission of
rape; and (c) that they were present at the time when the commission of rape took
place.108.

bigamy was being committed and the throwing the holy rice over the couple did not amount to
abetment of bigamy notwithstanding that one of the accused persons distributed pan after the
ceremony. Followed in CS Vardachari v CS Shanti, 1987 Cr LJ 1048 over similar facts.
