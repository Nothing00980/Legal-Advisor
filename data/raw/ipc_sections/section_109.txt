When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.
If the offence be not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding
section, the right of private defence of the body does not extend to the voluntary
causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions mentioned in
section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death.
COMMENT.â€”
Any harm short of death can be inflicted in exercising the right of private defence in any
case which does not fall within the provisions of section 100. Thus, where only some
mischief was caused to the factory and some brickbats were thrown by agitating
workers, the owner of the factory was not justified in killing a worker by firing a shot
from his revolver. As there was no apprehension of death or grievous hurt to his person,
the accused could not get the benefit of clauses (1) and (2) of section 100 or section
103, IPC, 1860. He had only a limited right of private defence to cause any other harm
than death within the meaning of section 101, IPC, 1860, and as such having exercised
his right of private defence he was liable to be convicted under section 304-Part I, IPC,
1860.480. The accused was hit by a single brickbat or a stone piece and suffered a
simple head-injury. After sometime he fired at the unarmed assailant causing grievous
injury to his abdomen. The Supreme Court held that keeping in mind his simple hurt
and the time gap between that and the gunshot wound caused by him, his action was a
retaliation rather than act of private defence. His conviction under section 326 was
accordingly upheld.481. The right of private defence was held to have been exceeded
where a member of the opposite side was killed after snatching his pistol.482. The
person who died came along with his brothers to stage a fight with the accused
because of an earlier act of insult on the part of the accused. A single stab wound was
administered to him, which fell upon his lower abdomen, of which he died. The accused
and his wife were also injured in the process. It was held that the accused had not
exceeded his right of private defence.483.
When dealing with questions relating to right of private defence of the body this section
and section 100 should be read together.
