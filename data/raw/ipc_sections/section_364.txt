Kidnapping from lawful guardianship.
Whoever takes or entices any minor under 1055.[sixteen] years of age if a male, or
under 1056.[eighteen] years of age if a female, or any person of unsound mind, out of
the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor or person of unsound mind, without
the consent of such guardian, is said to kidnap such minor or person from lawful
guardianship.
Explanation.—The words "lawful guardian" in this section include any person lawfully
entrusted with the care or custody of such minor or other person.
Exception.—This section does not extend to the act of any person who in good faith
believes himself to be the father of an illegitimate child, or who in good faith believes
himself to be entitled to the lawful custody of such child, unless such act is
committed for an immoral or unlawful purpose.
State Amendment
Manipur.—The following amendments were made by Act No. 80 of 1950, s. 3(2) (w.e.f.
16-4-1950) read with Act 81 of 1971, s. 3 (w.e.f. 25-1-1972).
In its application to the State of Manipur, in Section 361 for the word "eighteen"
substituted the word "fifteen".
COMMENT.—
The offence under this section may be committed in respect of either a minor or a
person of unsound mind. To kidnap a grown-up person of sound mind, therefore, would
not amount to an offence under it.
[s 361.1] Object.—
The object of this section is at least as much to protect children of tender age from
being abducted or seduced for improper purposes, as for the protection of the rights of
parents and guardians having the lawful charge or custody of minors or insane
persons.
[s 361.2] Ingredients.—
This section has four essentials1057..—
(1) Taking or enticing away a minor or a person of unsound mind.
(2) Such minor must be under 16 years of age, if a male, or under 18 years of age, if
a female.
(3) The taking or enticing must be out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such
minor or person of unsound mind.
(4) Such taking or enticing must be without the consent of such guardian.
[s 361.3] 'Takes or entices any minor'.—
The Supreme Court considered the interpretation of expression 'takes or entices' in S
Varadarajan v State of Madras,1058. and State of Haryana v Rajaram.1059. The purpose
and object of section 361 IPC, 1860 appears to be in dispute. In Varadarajan, the
Supreme Court had occasion to consider this. In section 498 IPC, 1860 we find
identical expression 'takes or entices' employed by the legislature. That was of course
for a totally different offence. While considering the object of section 361 IPC, 1860,
the Supreme Court in Varadarajan, took the view that the interpretation of the
expression 'takes or entices' in section 498 IPC, 1860 cannot be blindly and
mechanically imported while considering the interpretation of the same expression in
section 361 IPC, 1860. It took the view that section 498 IPC, 1860 is meant essentially
for protection of the rights of the husband, whereas section 361 IPC, 1860 and other
cognate sections of the IPC, 1860 are intended more for the protection of minors and
persons of unsound mind than the rights of the guardians of such persons. But in
Rajaram, the Supreme Court held that:
The object of this section seems as much to protect the minor children from being seduced
for improper purposes as to protect the rights and privileges of guardians having the lawful
charge or custody of their minor wards. The gravamen of this offence lies in the taking or
enticing of a minor under the ages specified in this section, out of the keeping of the lawful
guardian without the consent of such guardian. The words 'takes or entices any minor … out
of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor' in S. 361, are significant. The use of the
word 'keeping' in the context connotes the idea of charge, protection, maintenance and
control: further the guardian's charge and control appears to be compatible with the
independence of action and movement in the minor, the guardian's protection and control of
the minor being available, whenever necessity arises. On plain reading of this section the
consent of the minor who is taken or enticed is wholly immaterial: it is only the guardian's
consent which takes the case out of its purview. Nor is it necessary that the taking or
enticing must be shown to have been by means of force or fraud. Persuasion by the
accused person which creates willingness on the part of the minor to be taken out of the
keeping of the lawful guardian would be sufficient to attract the section.
A person who allows such a minor who is already out of the keeping of the guardian to
accompany him commits no offence under section 361 IPC, 1860. That alone is the
dictum in Varadarajan. It is no authority on the question whether consent of a minor
(even a knowledgeable minor close to 18 years) is relevant or crucial in a prosecution
under section 361 IPC, 1860. Later a two-Judge Bench in T D Vadgama v State of
Gujarat,1060. ascertained the precise distinction in the dictum between the three-Judge
Benches in Varadarajan and Rajaram. The dictum in Varadarajan turned on its own
peculiar facts. It was held:
it would, however, be sufficient if the prosecution establishes that though immediately prior
to the minor leaving the father's protection no active part was played by the accused, he had
at some earlier stage solicited or persuaded the minor to do so. In our opinion, if evidence to
establish one of those things is lacking, it would not be legitimate to infer that the accused
is guilty of taking the minor out of the keeping of the lawful guardian merely because after
she has actually left her guardian's house or a house where her guardian had kept her, joined
the accused and the accused helped her in her design not to return to her guardian's house
by taking her along with him from place to place. No doubt, the part played by the accused
could be regarded as facilitating the fulfilment of the intention of the girl. That part, in our
opinion, falls short of an inducement to the minor to slip out of the keeping of her lawful
guardian and is, therefore, not tantamount to 'taking'.
The intention with which kidnapping is effected can be ascertained from the
circumstances of the offence at the time of occurrence or prior or subsequent to it. A
kidnapping does not per se lead to any inference of intent or purpose of
kidnapping.1061. Persuasion by the accused which created willingness on the part of
the minor to be taken out of the keeping of the lawful guardian was held by the
Supreme Court to be enough to attract section 361. The Supreme Court also restated
the ingredients.1062.
Promise of marriage made to the minor girl for leaving the house of the lawful guardian
was held to be an enticement.1063.
The word 'take' means 'to cause to go' to escort or to get into possession. It implies
want of wish and absence of desire of the person taken. There is a distinction between
taking and allowing a minor to accompany a person.1064.
[s 361.4] When 'taking' is complete.—
The offence of kidnapping from lawful guardianship is complete when the minor is
actually taken from lawful guardianship; it is not an offence continuing so long as the
minor is kept out of such guardianship. In determining whether a person takes a minor
out of the lawful keeping of its guardian, the distance to which the minor is taken away
is immaterial.1065.
[s 361.5] 'Enticing'
is an act of the accused by which the person kidnapped is induced of his own accord to
go to the kidnapper. The word 'entice' involves an idea of inducement or allurement by
exciting hope or desire in the other. It may take many forms difficult to visualise. It is
not necessary that 'taking' or 'enticing' should be by means of force or fraud. The word
'entice' involves the idea of inducement or allurement.1066.
[s 361.6] 'Under sixteen years of age if a male, or under eighteen years of age,
if a female'.—
In the case of a boy the age limit is fixed at 16 years; in the case of a girl at 18 by Act
XLII of 1949. Before this amendment the age limit was 14 and 16 respectively. Where a
girl under that age is kidnapped, it is no defence that the accused did not know the girl
to be under that age, or that from her appearance he might have thought that she was
of a greater age.1067. Anyone dealing with such a girl does so at his peril, and if she
turns out to be under 18 he must take the consequences,1068. even though he bona fide
believed and had reasonable ground for believing that she was over eighteen.1069.
[s 361.7] 'Any person of unsound mind'.—
If the person kidnapped is normally of sound mind but is made unconscious from
poisoning, such a person cannot be said to be of unsound mind. For example, a person
under an anaesthetic for an operation can hardly be said to be of unsound mind. Where
a girl aged 20 years had been made unconscious from dhatura poisoning when she
was taken away, it was held that she could not be said to be a person of unsound mind,
and the person taking her away could not be guilty of kidnapping.1070.
[s 361.8] 'Out of the keeping of the lawful guardian'.—
The Legislature has advisedly preferred the expression 'the keeping of the lawful
guardian' to the word 'possession'. The word 'keeping' is compatible with the
independence of action and movement in the object kept.1071.
Persuasion by the accused is sufficient to constitute 'taking' within the meaning of this
section. Consent of the minor is wholly immaterial. It is only the guardian's consent that
takes the case out of the purview of this section.1072.
In Vipin Menon v State of Karnataka,1073. it was held that the father, in the absence of
divestment of right of guardianship, cannot be guilty of kidnapping his minor child.
[s 361.9] Explanation.—'Lawful guardian'.—
The Explanation is intended to extend the protection given to parents to any person
lawfully entrusted with the care or custody of the minor.1074.
Where the order in favour of the mother was passed by the lower Court but it was
stayed by the High Court, it was held that the father who had custody of the minor child
would continue to be in lawful custody until further orders. The Supreme Court clarified
that the law in India is to be governed by the provisions of IPC, 1860 and not the US
International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act, 1993.1075.
[s 361.10] 'Entrustment'.—
Entrustment, which this section requires, may be inferred from a well-defined and
consistent course of conduct governing the relations of the minor and the person
alleged to be the lawful guardian.1076.
