Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for
person's benefit.
Nothing which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm
which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be
likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has
given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of
that harm.
ILLUSTRATION
A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who
suffers under a painful complaint, but not intending to cause Z's death and intending in
good faith, Z's benefit performs that operation on Z, with Z's consent. A has committed
no offence.
COMMENT.—
The preceding section allows any harm to be inflicted short of death or grievous hurt.
This section sanctions the infliction of any harm if it is for the benefit of the person to
whom it is caused. No consent can justify an intentional causing of death. But a person
for whose benefit a thing is done may consent that another shall do that thing, even if
death may probably ensue. If a person gives his free and intelligent consent to take the
risk of an operation which, in a large proportion of cases, has proved fatal, the surgeon
who operates cannot be punished even if death ensues.213. Again; if a person attacked
by a wild beast should call out to his friends to fire, though with imminent hazard to
himself, and they were to obey the call, we do not conceive that it would be expedient
to punish them, though they might by firing cause his death, and though when they fired
they knew themselves to be likely to cause his death.214.
This section differs from the last section in two particulars—(1) under it any harm
except death may be inflicted; (2) the age of the person consenting is not mentioned
(but see section 90 under which the age of the consenting party must at least be 12
years).
Persons not qualified as medical practitioners cannot claim the benefit of this section
as they can hardly be deemed to act in 'good faith' as that expression is defined in
section 52.215.
[s 88.1] Criminal liability on doctor or surgeon.—
Prosecution has to come out with a case of high degree of negligence on part of
doctor. Thus, when a patient agrees to go for medical treatment or surgical operation,
every careless act of the medical man cannot be termed as 'criminal.' It can be termed
'criminal' only when the medical man exhibits a gross lack of competence or inaction
and wanton indifference to his patient's safety and which is found to have arisen from
gross ignorance or gross negligence. Where a patient's death results merely from error
of judgment or an accident, no criminal liability should be attached to it. Mere
inadvertence or some degree of want of adequate care and caution might create civil
liability but would not suffice to hold him criminally liable.216. Even if the surgery was
done without the consent of the patient or his/her guardian, if it is for the benefit of the
patient he is not liable. Section 98 deals with harm caused with the consent of the
person injured or someone competent under law to give such consent on his behalf
excludes causing of such harm from the category of offence. Here the complainant has
given her consent. Section 88 IPC, 1860 provides that harm done for the benefit of the
person injured and with his consent will not make the person causing harm liable for
criminal offence.217.
