Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery.
If any person, in committing or in attempting to commit robbery, voluntarily causes
hurt, such person, and any other person jointly concerned in committing or attempting
to commit such robbery, shall be punished with 177.[imprisonment for life], or with
rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be
liable to fine.
COMMENT—
This section imposes severe punishment when hurt is caused in committing robbery.
Section 397 similarly provides for the minimum sentence of imprisonment which must
be inflicted when grievous hurt is caused.
Commenting on the section, the Supreme Court observed: section 394 prescribes
punishment for voluntarily causing hurt in committing or attempting to commit robbery.
The offence under section 394 is a more serious than one under section 392. Section
394 postulates and contemplates the causing of harm during commission of robbery
or in attempting to commit robbery when such causing of hurt is hardly necessary to
facilitate the commission of robbery. Section 394 applies to cases where during the
course of robbery voluntary hurt is caused. Section 394 classifies two distinct classes
of persons. Firstly, those who actually cause hurt and secondly, those who do not
actually cause hurt but are "jointly concerned" in the commission of the offence of
robbery. The second class of persons may not be concerned in the causing of hurt, but
they become liable independently of the knowledge of its likelihood or a reasonable
belief in its probability.178.
In a prosecution for robbery and murder, injuries were caused to the deceased in the
process of removing earrings. The Court said that the fact that the booty was
distributed among three accused and they had secreted the robbed articles. These
things revealed the common intention to commit robbery. One of them picked up a
stone piece and caused death of the victim. There was nothing to show that the
accused even knew of any such possibility. Others could not be convicted of murder
and robbery with the help of presumption under section 114 Evidence Act, 1872. They
were liable to be convicted only under sections 394/34.179.
[s 394.1] Forceful removal of vehicle by finance company.—
Forcible removal of vehicle from possession of purchaser by finance company on
default of payment without recourse to proper remedy through civil Court or to
arbitration clause, contained in hypothecation agreement, would be covered under
section 394 of IPC, 1860.180. The practice of hiring recovery agents, who are
musclemen, is deprecated and needs to be discouraged. The Bank should resort to
procedure recognized by law to take possession of vehicles in cases where the
borrower may have committed default in payment of the instalments instead of taking
resort to strong-arm tactics. The recovery of loans or seizure of vehicles could be done
only through legal means. The banks cannot employ goondas to take possession by
force.181.
[s 394.2] Charge framed under sections 394 and 397.—
There is nothing wrong in convicting the accused under section 394 read with section
397.182. All ingredients of offence punishable under section 392 are covered in offence
under section 394.183. Section 397 of the IPC, 1860 prescribes enhanced punishment
for using a deadly weapon at the time of committing robbery. As an obvious corollary,
section 397 had no application to the case where robbery was not actually completed.
Even so, measure of punishment had to be regulated by section 398 of the IPC, 1860
that provides for minimum punishment of seven years imprisonment in a case of
attempt to commit robbery when armed with deadly weapon. In this view of the matter,
the conviction of the appellants for the offence under section 394 read with section
397 of the IPC, 1860 deserves to be converted into one under section 394 read with
section 398 of the IPC, 1860.184.
[s 394.3] Compounding.—
An offence punishable under section 394 IPC, 1860 is not compoundable with or
without the permission of the Court concerned. But High Court can use its power under
section 482 Cr PC, 1973 for quashing the prosecution under the said provision in the
light of the compromise that the parties have arrived at.185.
[s 394.4] Presumption under section 114(a) of Evidence Act, 1872.—
As per Section 114(a) of the Evidence Act, 1872, when the stolen property is recovered
from a person, soon after the commission of theft or dacoity, a presumption can be raised
that either he has himself committed the offence of theft or he has received the stolen
property.186.

hurt, but also an associate would be equally liable for the mischief contemplated by the section.

SCC 1 [LNIND 2011 SC 1153] : AIR 2012 SC 509 [LNIND 2011 SC 1153] -even in case of
mortgaged goods subject to Hire Purchase Agreements, the recovery process has to be in
accordance with law and the recovery process referred to in the Agreements also contemplates
such recovery to be effected in due process of law and not by use of force. Till such time as the
ownership is not transferred to the purchaser, the hirer normally continues to be the owner of
the goods, but that does not entitle him on the strength of the agreement to take back
possession of the vehicle by use of force. The guidelines which had been laid down by the
Reserve Bank of India as well as the appellant bank itself, in fact, support and make a virtue of
such conduct. If any action is taken for recovery in violation of such guidelines or the principles
as laid down by this Court, such an action cannot but be struck down.
