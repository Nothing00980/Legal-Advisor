COMMENT.â€”
For an offence under section 243, IPC, 1860, it has to be established by the prosecution
that accused fraudulently or with intent that fraud may be committed, came into
possession of counterfeit coins which were counterfeit of Indian coins, having known
at the time he became possessed of them that they were counterfeit.31. Where the
coins were not counterfeit coins but were in the process of being made counterfeit
coins, section 243 has no application.32.
30. Subs. by the A.O. 1950, for "Queen's coin".
