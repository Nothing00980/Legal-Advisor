Making a false mark upon any receptacle containing goods.
Whoever makes any false mark upon any case, package or other receptacle
containing goods, in a manner reasonably calculated to cause any public servant or
any other person to believe that such receptacle contains goods which it does not
contain or that it does not contain goods which it does contain, or that the goods
contained in such receptacle are of a nature or quality different from the real nature or
quality thereof, shall, unless he proves that he acted without intent to defraud, be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
three years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This section is more comprehensive than sections 482 and 486. The fraudulent making
of false marks of any description on goods for the purpose of deceiving public
servants, such as customs officers, is punishable under this section.
