Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use1 any movable
property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing, at
the time when he takes it, that the property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of
theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the
property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes
away a book without Z's express consent. Here, if A was under the impression
that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A
has not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit,
he is guilty of an offence under this section.
(c) A and B, being joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession,
intending to use it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not
dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the
whole proceeds to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation
within the meaning of this section.
ILLUSTRATION
A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A,
knowing that the note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan,
intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this
section.
Explanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other
person, and takes such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it
to, the owner does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an
offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates it to his own
use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used
reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property
a reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it.
What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question
of fact.
It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or
that any particular person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of
appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believes
that the real owner cannot be found.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs. A
picks up the rupee. Here A has not committed the offence defined in this
section.
(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a banknote. From the direction and
contents of the letter he learns to whom the note belongs. He appropriates the
note. He is guilty of an offence under this section.
(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person
who has lost the cheque. But the name of the person, who has drawn the
cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in
whose favour the cheque was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without
attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section.
(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention
of restoring it to Z, but afterwards appropriates it to his own use. A has
committed an offence under this section.
(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards
discovers that it belongs to Z, and appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of
an offence under this section.
(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately
without attempting to discover the owner. A is guilty of an offence under this
section.
COMMENT—
Criminal misappropriation takes place when the possession has been innocently come
by, but where, by a subsequent change of intention, or from the knowledge of some
new fact with which the party was not previously acquainted, the retaining becomes
wrongful and fraudulent.257. The offence consists in the dishonest misappropriation or
conversion, either permanently or for a time, of property which is already without wrong
in the possession of the offender.258. See illustrations (a), (b) and (c) which show that
the original innocent taking amounts to criminal misappropriation by subsequent acts.
Illustration (a) is qualified by ill. (b).259.
[s 403.1] Ingredients.—
This section requires—
(1) Dishonest misappropriation or conversion of property for a person's own use.
(2) Such property must be movable. Section 403 deals with the offence of dishonest
misappropriation of property. It provides that "whoever dishonestly misappropriates or
converts to his own use any movable property", shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or both. The
basic requirement for attracting the section is: (i) the movable property in question
should belong to a person other than the accused; (ii) the accused should wrongly
appropriate or convert such property to his own use; and (iii) there should be dishonest
intention on the part of the accused. Here again the basic requirement is that the
subject matter of dishonest misappropriation or conversion should be someone else's
movable property. When NEPC India owns/possesses the aircraft, it obviously cannot
'misappropriate or convert to its own use' such aircraft or parts thereof. Therefore,
section 403 is also not attracted.260. Section 403 uses the words 'dishonestly' and
'misappropriate'. These are necessary ingredients of an offence under section 403, IPC,
1860.261.
1. 'Dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use'.—There must be actual
conversion of the thing misappropriated to the accused's own use. Where, therefore,
the accused found a thing, and merely retained it in his possession, he was acquitted of
this offence.262. Where the accused found a purse on the pavement of a temple in a
crowded gathering and put it in his pocket but was immediately after arrested, it was
held that he was not guilty of criminal misappropriation, for it could not be assumed
that by the mere act of picking up the purse or putting it in his pocket he intended to
appropriate its contents to his own use.263. Where a person took possession of a
bullock which had strayed, but there was no evidence that it was stolen property, and
he dishonestly retained it, he could be convicted under this section and not under
section 411.264. The accused purchased for one anna, from a child aged six years, two
pieces of cloth valued at 15 annas, which the child had taken from the house of a third
person. It was held that assuming that a charge of dishonest reception of property
(section 411) could not be sustained owing to the incapacity of the child to commit an
offence, the accused was guilty of criminal misappropriation, if he knew that the
property belonged to the child's guardian and dishonestly appropriated it to his own
use.265.
[s 403.2] Theft and criminal misappropriation.—
(1) In theft the offender dishonestly takes property which is in the possession of a
person out of that person's possession; and the offence is complete as soon as the
offender moves the property. Criminal misappropriation takes place even when the
possession has been innocently come by, but where, by a subsequent change of
intention or from the knowledge of some new fact, with which the party was not
previously acquainted, the retaining becomes wrongful and fraudulent.
(2) The dishonest intention to appropriate the property of another is common to theft
and to criminal misappropriation. But this intention, which in theft is sufficiently
manifested by a moving of the property, must in criminal misappropriation be carried
into action by an actual misappropriation or conversion.
[s 403.3] Entrustment of cash.—
Where a certain amount of cash, which was entrusted to the cashier, was missing from
the bank and the money was neither found with the cashier nor at his home, the Court
said that he could be held liable for negligence but not for breach of trust in the
absence of proof for misappropriation by him.266.
[s 403.4] Joint property.—
An owner of property, in whichever way he uses his property and with whatever
intention, will not be liable for misappropriation and that would be so even if he is not
the exclusive owner thereof. A partner has undefined ownership along with the other
partners over all the assets of the partnership. If he chooses to use any of them for his
own purposes he may be accountable civilly to the other partners. But he does not
thereby commit misappropriation.267.
[s 403.5] Main contractor receiving payment but not paying to sub-contractor.
—
The principal or main contractor contracted with a sub-contractor for completion of the
project. The sub-contractor filed a criminal complaint alleging that the main contractor
had received payment under the project but was not paying him. The Supreme Court
said that the money paid to the main contractor was not in the nature of money or
immovable property of the sub-contractor. Hence, there could be no misappropriation.
It was a claim of civil nature.268.
[s 403.6] Civil nature.—
When the dispute in question is purely of civil nature, Magistrate is justified in
dismissing the complaint under section 203 Cr PC, 1973.269. Merely because a civil
claim has been raised by the complainant regarding the breach of agreement, it cannot
prevent him from initiating criminal proceedings.270.
[s 403.7] Charge under section 406.—Conviction under section 403.—
Section 222(1) Cr PC, 1973 provides when a person is charged with an offence
consisting of several particulars, a combination of some only of which constitutes a
complete minor offence, and such combination is proved, but the remaining particulars
are not proved, he may be convicted of the minor offence, though he was not charged
with it. Sub-section (2) of section 222 provides that when a person is charged with an
offence and facts are proved which reduced it to a minor offence, he may be convicted
of the minor offence, although he is not charged with it. Offence under section 403 is
certainly a minor offence in relation to the offence under section 406, IPC, 1860.271.
[s 403.8] Offence partly committed outside India.—
Indian Courts have jurisdiction against foreigners residing in foreign countries but their
acts connected with transaction or part of transaction arising in India. Foreign
nationality, their residence outside India, and the fact that they were not present in India
when the offence(s) was/were allegedly committed, are of no consequence, in view of
the aforesaid decision rendered by the Supreme Court in Mobarik Ali Ahmed272.

cannot be said that there is any dishonest intention on the part of appellants nor it can be said
that TCPL or the appellants have misappropriated or converted the movable property of the
complainant to their own use. Since the basic ingredients of the relevant Section in the IPC,
1860 are not satisfied, the order taking cognizance of the offence as well as the issue of
summons to the appellants is wholly uncalled for.
