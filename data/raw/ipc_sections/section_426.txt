Cheating.
Whoever, by deceiving any person1, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so
deceived to deliver any property2 to any person, or to consent that any person shall
retain any property,3 or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to
do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived,4 and which act
or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind,
reputation or property,5 is said to "cheat".
Explanation.—A dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of
this section.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A, by falsely pretending to be in the Civil Service, intentionally deceives Z, and
thus dishonestly induces Z to let him have on credit goods for which he does not
mean to pay. A cheats.

COMMENT—
In most of the foregoing offences relating to property the offender merely got
possession of the thing in question, but in the case of cheating he obtains possession
plus property in it.
The authors of the Code observe: "We propose to make it cheating to obtain property
by deception in all cases where the property is fraudulently obtained; that is to say, in all
cases where the intention of the person who has by deceit obtained the property was
to cause a distribution of property which the law pronounces to be a wrongful
distribution, and in no other case whatever. However immoral a deception may be, we
do not consider it as an offence against the rights of property if its object is only to
cause a distribution of property which the law recognizes as rightful.
"We propose to punish as guilty of cheating a man who, by false representations,
obtains a loan of money, not meaning to repay it; a man who, by false representations,
obtains an advance of money, not meaning to perform the service or to deliver the
article for which the advance is given; a man who, by falsely pretending to have
performed work for which he was hired, obtains pay to which he is not entitled.
"In all these cases there is deception. In all, the deceiver's object is fraudulent. He
intends in all these cases to acquire or retain wrongful possession of that to which
some other person has a better claim and which that other person is entitled to recover
by law. In all these cases, therefore, the object has been wrongful gain, attended with
wrongful loss. In all, therefore, there has, according to our definition, been cheating".472.
[s 415.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires—
(1) Deception of any person.
(2) (a) Fraudulently or dishonestly inducing that person—
(i) to deliver any property to any person; or
(ii) to consent that any person shall retain any property; or
(b) Intentionally inducing that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not
do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to
cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property.473. There
are two separate classes of acts which the persons deceived may be induced to do. In
the first place he may be induced fraudulently or dishonestly to deliver any property to
any person. The second class of acts set-forth in the section is the doing or omitting to
do anything which the person deceived would not do or omit to do if he were not so
deceived. In the first class of cases the inducing must be fraudulent or dishonest. In the
second class of acts, the inducing must be intentional but not fraudulent or
dishonest.474.
In the definition of cheating there are set forth two separate classes of acts which the
person deceived may be induced to do. In the first place, he may be induced
fraudulently or dishonestly to deliver any property to any person or to consent that any
person shall retain any property. The second class of acts set forth in the section is the
doing or omitting to do anything which the person deceived would not do or omit to do
if he were not so deceived. In the first class of cases the inducing must be fraudulent or
dishonest. In the second class of acts the inducing must be intentional but not
fraudulent or dishonest.
The definition of the offence of cheating embraces some cases in which no transfer of
property is occasioned by the deception and some in which such a transfer occurs; for
these cases generally provision is made in section 417 of the Code. For cases in which
property is transferred a more specific provision is made by section 420.
The offence of cheating is not committed if a third party, on whom no deception has
been practised, sustains pecuniary loss in consequence of the accused's act.475.
[s 415.2] Cheating and extortion.—
The offence of cheating must, like that of extortion, be committed by the wrongful
obtaining of a consent. The difference is that the extortioner obtains the consent by
intimidation, and the cheat by deception.476.
[s 415.3] Breach of contract and cheating.—
The distinction between mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating is a fine
one. It depends upon the intention of the accused at the time of inducement which may
be judged by his subsequent conduct, but for which the subsequent conduct is not the
sole test. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution under
section 420, IPC, 1860, unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the
beginning of the transaction, which is the time when the offence is said to have been
committed.477. There was allegation from one side that no payment was being made
under the contract. The other side pleaded that part payments were made from time to
time and the balance was withheld due to non-standard nature of the work and a letter
to that effect was issued. The Court said that the controversy was wholly of civil
nature. There was total absence of dishonest criminal intention to dupe contractions'
right from the inception of the relationship.478. Although breach of contract per se
would not come in the way of initiation of a criminal proceeding, there cannot be any
doubt whatsoever that in absence of the averments made in the complaint petition
wherefrom the ingredients of an offence can be found out, the Court should not
hesitate to exercise its jurisdiction under section 482 of the Cr PC, 1973.479.
The distinction was explained by the Supreme Court in a case involving an agreement
for sale of property. The allegation in the complaint was that the seller had not
disclosed that one of his brothers had filed a partition suit which was pending. There
was no allegation that non-disclosure of the suit was intentional. The dishonest
intention on the part of the accused at the beginning of negotiations was not made out
by averments in the complaint. The High Court was wrong in declining to quash the
criminal proceedings.480.
The accused promised, propagated and induced the public through advertisements to
invest money in a circulation scheme. Double the money was promised to a member
who enrolled 14 new members. The scheme was found to be practically impossible.
Thus there was an element of cheating.481.
[s 415.4] Dishonest intention at the time of making the promise a sine qua non
for the offence of cheating.—
To hold a person guilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had a fraudulent or
dishonest intention at the time of making the promise. From mere fact that the
promisor could not keep his promise, it cannot be presumed that he all along had a
culpable intention to break the promise from the beginning.482.
[s 415.5] Cheating, criminal breach of trust, and criminal misappropriation.—
Cheating differs from the last two offences in the fact that the cheat takes possession
of property by deception. There is wrongful gain or loss in both cases and in both
cases there is inducement to deliver property. In the case of cheating the dishonest
intention starts with the very inception of the transaction. But in the case of criminal
breach of trust, the person who comes into possession of but retains it or converts it to
his own use against the terms of the contract.483.
Criminal breach of trust and cheating are two distinct offences generally involving
dishonest intention but mutually exclusive and different in basic concept. The former is
voluntary but the latter is purely on the basis of inducement with dishonest
intention.484.
1. 'Deceiving any person'.—Deceiving means causing to believe what is false, or
misleading as to a matter of fact, or leading into error. Whenever a person fraudulently
represents as an existing fact that which is not an existing fact, he commits this
offence. A wilful misrepresentation of a definite fact with intent to defraud, cognizable
by the senses—as where a seller represents the quantity of coal to be 14 cwt. whereas
it is in fact only eight cwt. but so packed as to look more; or where the seller, by
manoeuvring, contrives to pass off tasters of cheese as if extracted from the cheese
offered for sale, whereas it is not—is a cheating.485. Deception is a necessary
ingredient for the offences of cheating under both parts of this section. The
complainant, therefore, necessarily needs to prove that the inducement had been
caused by the deception exercised by the accused. Such deception must necessarily
produce the inducement to part with or deliver property, which the complainant would
not have parted with or delivered, but for the inducement resulting from deception. The
explanation to the section would clearly indicate that there must be no dishonest
concealment of facts. In other words, non-disclosure of relevant information would
also be treated as a misrepresentation of facts leading to deception.486.
It is not sufficient to prove that a false representation had been made but it is further
necessary to prove that the representation was false to the knowledge of the accused
and was made in order to deceive the complainant.487. Where a party was persuaded
to take out a policy of insurance and the insurer subsequently failed to pay on the
happening of the event insured against, it was held that a dishonest intention cannot be
inferred from a subsequent failure to fulfil a promise.488.
It is not necessary that the false pretence should be made in express words; it can be
inferred from all the circumstances attending the obtaining of the property,489. or from
conduct.490. If a person orders out goods on credit promising to pay for them on a
particular day knowing that it was impossible for him to pay, this would amount to
cheating. But the mere fact that he is in embarrassed circumstances does not lead to
such inference.491.
[s 415.6] Cheque discounting facility.—
The complainant is required to show that accused had fraudulent or dishonest
intention at the time of making promise or representation. In the absence of culpable
intention at the time of making initial promise, no offence is made out under section
420. In present case, the allowing of cheque discounting facility by bank officials to
customers of the bank, without any criminal intent being proved, did not amount to
commission of offence, particularly as facility allowed was not contrary to RBI
Guidelines. It could not also be said that there was a meeting of minds in a conspiracy
to commit an offence, nor an act of corruption could be inferred from transactions
between the bank and its customers. The accused officials might have been
prosecuted under section 409 but they were not so charged. Their conviction was set
aside.492.
2. 'Fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any
property'.—The words 'fraudulently' and 'dishonestly' do not govern the whole of the
definition of cheating. The section is divided into two parts, the second of which
provides for the case of a person who, by deceiving another intentionally, induces the
person so deceived to do an act which causes or is likely to cause damage or harm
although the deceiver has not acted fraudulently or dishonestly.493.
3. 'Or to consent that any person shall retain any property'.—It is cheating whether a
deception causes a person fraudulently or dishonestly to acquire property by delivery,
or to retain property already in his possession.
Property does not have to be a thing which has money or market value. Since a
passport is a tangible thing and a document of great importance for travel abroad there
can be no doubt that it is property within the meaning of this section. Thus where the
accused obtained several passports by making false representation to the passport
issuing authority they were rightly convicted under sections 420 and 420/120B, IPC,
1860.494.
4. 'Intentionally inducing that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not
do or omit, etc.'.—Intention is the gist of the offence. The person cheated must have
been intentionally induced to do an act which he would not have done or to omit to do
an act which he would have done, owing to the deception practised on him. The
intention at the time of the offence and the consequence of the act or omission itself
has to be considered.495. Intent refers to the dominant motive of action, and not to a
casual or merely possible result.496. Where the facts narrated in the complaint revealed
a commercial transaction, it was held that such a transaction could not lead to the
conclusion of a criminal intention to cheat. The Court said that the crux of this offence
is the intention of the accused person.497.
Sections 415 read with section 420 indicates that fraudulent or dishonest inducement
on the part of the accused must be at the inception and not at a subsequent stage. In
this case, blank cheques were handed over to the accused during the period 2000–
2004 for use of business purposes but the dispute between the parties admittedly
arose much after that, i.e., in 2005. Thus, no case for proceeding against the
respondent under section 420 is made out. Filling up of the blanks in a cheque by itself
would not amount to forgery. A case for proceeding against the respondents under
section 406 IPC, 1860 has been made out. A cheque being a property, the same was
entrusted to the respondents. If the property has been misappropriated has been used
for a purpose for which the same had been handed over, a case under section 406 IPC,
1860 may be found to have been made out. It may be true that even in a proceeding
under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, the appellant could raise a defence
that the cheques were not meant to be used towards discharge of a lawful liability or a
debt, but the same by itself would not mean that in an appropriate case, a complaint
petition cannot be allowed to be filed.498.
The existence of fraudulent intention at the time of making promise or
misrepresentation is a necessary ingredient. The mere failure on the part of the
accused to keep up the promise is not sufficient to prove the existence of such
intention from the beginning.499.
[s 415.7] Fraudulent or dishonest intention to be at the outset.—
To hold a person guilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had fraudulent or
dishonest intention at the time of making the promise. From his mere failure to keep up
the promise subsequently such a culpable intention right at the beginning, that is, when
he made the promise cannot be presumed.500.
A beverages company entered into a bottling agreement with a bottling company for
bottling services for a period of five years, subsequently, however, the beverage
company transferred its trade mark to another company to which the bottling
agreement was also assigned. But the latter company terminated the agreement. The
bottling company filed a complaint for cheating saying that they had spent a huge
amount in setting up their bottling unit. The complaint was quashed. There was no
arrangement with the beverages company at the time when the complainant was
bringing up his unit, nor did the beverages company have any intention of cheating
from the start or at any subsequent stage.501.
Although it is necessary that there should be misrepresentation from the very
beginning, the intention to cheat may in some cases develop at a later stage in the
process of formation of the contract. The respondent in this case was a co-sharer in
the joint property. The other co-sharers sold it to others representing that they had one-
third share in the property when in fact it was not so. It was held that no cheating was
practiced in the transaction upon the complaining co-sharer. It was a fraud on others.
The complainant could not launch a criminal prosecution against them.502.
The illustration (b) provided in section 415, IPC, 1860, very well covers the facts of this
case for cheating by the accused. The illustration provides that "(b) A, by putting a
counterfoil mark on an article, intentionally deceives Z into a belief that this article was
made in a certain celebrated manufacturer, and thus dishonestly induces Z to buy and pay
for the article, A cheats."503.
[s 415.8] Civil and Criminal liability.—
A distinction must be made between a civil wrong and a criminal wrong. When dispute
between the parties constitute only a civil wrong and not a criminal wrong, the Courts
would not permit a person to be harassed although no case for taking cognizance of
the offence has been made out.504. The case of breach of trust or cheating is both a
civil wrong and a criminal offence, but under certain situations where the act alleged
would predominantly be a civil wrong, such an act does not constitute a criminal
offence.505. Sometimes case may apparently look to be of civil nature or may involve a
commercial transaction but civil disputes or commercial disputes in certain
circumstances may also contain ingredients of criminal offences and such disputes
have to be entertained notwithstanding they are also civil disputes.506.
[s 415.9] Cheating by Misrepresentation as to Encumbrance to Property.—
It is the intention which is important and not whether a man is under a legal duty to
disclose or suppress facts within his knowledge. Therefore, where a person with the
intention of causing wrongful loss to another makes a false representation to him or
suppresses certain facts, he will be said to have acted dishonestly even if the law does
not require him to state the truth. Therefore, the non-disclosure of the previous
encumbrances will not affect the rights of the previous mortgagees and will not pass a
complete title to the purchaser; the purchaser may nevertheless have been cheated.507.
Where the vendor of immovable property omitted to mention that there was an
encumbranceon the property, it was held that he could not be convicted of cheating
unless it was shown either that he was asked by the vendee whether the property was
encumbered and said it was not, or that he sold the property on the representation that
it was unencumbered.508.
[s 415.10] Disconnection of Electricity and Water by Landlord.—
The landlord disconnected the electricity and water supply of the tenant. The tenant
could not make out that the landlord had the fraudulent intention of deceiving the
tenant at the time of entering into the transaction of lease. Thus, there was no
possibility of conviction for an offence under section 415.509.
5. 'Which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person
in body, mind, reputation or property'.—The damage must be the direct, natural or
probable consequence of the induced act. The resulting damage or likelihood of
damage may not be within the actual contemplation of the accused when the deceit
was practised. The person deceived must have acted under the influence of deceit, and
the damage must not be too remote.510. The use of the expression "cause" in this
section postulates a direct and proximate casual connection between the act or
omission and the harm and damage to the victim.511.
It is necessary that the harm should be caused to the person deceived. Damage or
harm in mind covers both, injury to mental faculties or mental pain or anguish.512.
Where the accused falsely identified a person before the Oaths Commissioner and thus
induced him to attest an affidavit, it was held that no offence under section 419, IPC,
1860, was committed as the Oaths Commissioner did not suffer any harm in his body,
mind, reputation or property.513.
[s 415.11] Explanation.—
The Explanation refers to the actual deception itself and not to the concealment of a
deception by someone else. For the purposes of this section the concealment of fact
need not be illegal if it is dishonest.514.
[s 415.12] Trade mark.—
The Madras High Court has held that the infringement of a trade mark may constitute
the offence of cheating and, therefore, the FIR for the offence was not to be
quashed.515.
Selling property having no right to do so.—Where property is sold by a person knowing
that it does not belong to him, it was held that he defrauded the purchaser. The latter
could prosecute him under section 415, but no third person could do so.516.
The offence of cheating need not necessarily relate to property. It can also partake the
nature of personation. The accused in this case palmed off his sister as belonging to a
higher caste with the object of getting her married to the petitioner, a person of higher
caste. It was held that the offence fell under the second part of the definition.517.
[s 415.13] Prosecution of Company.—
In the case of Penal Code offences, for example under section 420 of the IPC, 1860, for
cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, the punishment prescribed is
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years and
shall also be liable to fine; and for the offence under section 417, that is, simple
cheating, the punishment prescribed is imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to one year or with fine or with both. If the appellants' plea is
accepted then for the offence under section 417 IPC, 1860, which is an offence of
minor nature, a company could be prosecuted and punished with fine whereas for the
offence under section 420, which is an aggravated form of cheating by which the victim
is dishonestly induced to deliver property, the company cannot be prosecuted as there
is a mandatory sentence of imprisonment. There is no immunity to the companies from
prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of offences for which the
punishment prescribed is mandatory imprisonment.518. A corporation is virtually in the
same position as any individual and may be convicted of common law as well as
statutory offences including those requiring mens rea. The criminal liability of a
corporation would arise when an offence is committed in relation to the business of the
corporation by a person or body of persons in control of its affairs. Companies and
corporate houses can no longer claim immunity from criminal prosecution on ground
that they are incapable of possessing necessary mens rea.519. Since, the majority of
the Constitution Bench ruled in Standard Chartered Bank v Directorate of
Enforcement,520. that the company can be prosecuted even in a case where the Court
can impose substantive sentence as also fine, and in such case only fine can be
imposed on the corporate body.521.
[s 415.14] Directors of Company.—
The Penal Code does not contain any provision for attaching vicarious liability on the
part of the Managing Director or the Directors of the Company when the accused is the
Company. The learned Magistrate failed to pose unto himself the correct question, viz.,
as to whether the complaint petition, even if given face value and taken to be correct in
its entirety, would lead to the conclusion that the respondents herein were personally
liable for any offence. The Bank is a body corporate. Vicarious liability of the Managing
Director and Director would arise provided any provision exists in that behalf in the
Statute. Statutes indisputably must contain provision fixing such vicarious liabilities.
Even for the said purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the complainant to make
requisite allegations which would attract the provisions constituting vicarious
liability.522.
[s 415.15] Vicarious liability of employees.—
A vicarious liability can be fastened only by reason of a provision of a statute and not
otherwise. For the said purpose, a legal fiction has to be created. Even under a special
statute when the vicarious criminal liability is fastened on a person on the premise that
he was in-charge of the affairs of the company and responsible to it, all the ingredients
laid down under the statute must be fulfilled. A legal fiction must be confined to the
object and purport for which it has been created." No case of criminal misconduct on
their part has been made out before the formation of the contract. There is nothing to
show that the appellants herein who hold different positions in the appellant-company
made any representation in their personal capacities and, thus, they cannot be made
vicariously liable only because they are employees of the company."523.
[s 415.16] Allotment of wagons on false letters.—
The accused who were railway employees tried to divert wagons by procuring their
allotment on fake letters of request issued by a fake firm, were held to be guilty of
cheating.524.
[s 415.17] Representation to Public Service Commission and other appointing
authority.—
The accused who was at the time serving in the Madras Medical Service as a Civil
Assistant Surgeon on a temporary basis applied for a permanent post notified by the
Madras Public Service Commission and made false representations as to his name,
place of birth, father's name and a degree held by him which was a necessary
qualification. His name was recommended by the Commission and he was appointed
by the Government to the post and drew his salary for several years before the fraud
was detected. It was held that although the Commission was an independent statutory
body performing advisory function, the deception of such adviser was deception of the
Government and the accused was liable under the section.525. Where a non-scheduled
caste candidate sat for the Indian Administrative Service Examination falsely declaring
himself to be a scheduled caste candidate in his application before the Union Public
Service Commission and thus obtained the advantage of the relaxed standard of
examination prescribed for scheduled caste candidates and eventually got appointed
as an IAS. officer by the Government of India, it was held that he had clearly cheated
both the Union Public Service Commission and the Government of India and was rightly
convicted under section 429, IPC, 1860.526.
Securing appointments from Government officials by producing fake letters from
Ministers and also by posing to be the brother of a minister, has been held to constitute
an offence of cheating by personation, and of forgery under sections 466–467 and of
forging Ministerial communications under section 468.527.
[s 415.18] Illustration(f).—
It may be that the facts narrated in the present complaint would as well reveal a
commercial transaction or money transaction. But that is hardly a reason for holding
that the offence of cheating would elude from such a transaction. In fact, many a
cheatings were committed in the course of commercial and also money transactions.
One of the illustrations set out under section 415 of the IPC, 1860 (Illustration f) is
worthy of notice now "(f) A intentionally deceives Z into a belief that A means to repay
any money that Z may lend to him and thereby dishonestly induces Z to lend him
money, A not intending to repay it. A cheats."528. On its plain language it is manifest
from this illustration that what is material is the intention of the drawer at the time the
cheque is issued, and the intention has to be gathered from the facts on the record. If
from the circumstances it is established that the failure to meet a cheque was not
accidental but was the consequence expected by the accused, the presumption would
be that the accused intended to cheat.529.
The accused introduced a person to the bank only for opening an account. It was held
that such act could not by itself spell out any intention to commit fraud or cheating.
The evidence did not show that the introducer was in any way connected with the fraud
committed on the bank by the person introduced or with the loss suffered by the bank.
He was accordingly acquitted of all charges.530.

allotted to another person. Thus, it seemed to the court that the accused did not have bona fide
intention from the beginning. Framing of charge-sheet under section 468 forgery for cheating
