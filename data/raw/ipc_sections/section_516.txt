STATE AMENDMENT
Andhra Pradesh.—In Andhra Pradesh the offence is cognizable vide G.O. Ms. No. 732,
dated 5-12-1991.
COMMENT.—
This section is aimed at reports calculated to produce mutiny or to induce one section
of the population to commit offences against another and to prevent and remove
communal and religious tensions. The Supreme Court has held that the provisions of
this section are not unconstitutional as being violative of the fundamental right of
freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.26. Sub-
sections (2) and (3) of this section have now been made cognizable offences under the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973). Of course, offences under this section
and sections 506 and 507, (IPC, 1860), can be made cognizable offences in specified
areas by the State Government by a notification in the official Gazette under section 10
of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932.
A mere threat which causes no alarm to the complainant does not constitute an
offence under the section.27.
[s 505.1] Sections 153A and 505.—
It is necessary under section 505 that there should be a publication of words or
representation intended for promoting feelings of enmity or hatred, but this is not
necessary under section 153A. Inciting of the feelings of one group merely without any
reference to another group does not attract section 153A or section 505.28. The Court
referred to the decision in Balwant Singh v State of Punjab,29. where the ruling was that
mens rea is a necessary ingredient for the offence under section 153A. Mens rea is an
equally necessary postulate for the offence under section 505(2) also as could be
discerned from the words "with intent to create or promote or which is likely to create
or promote" as used in that sub-section. The Court also referred to the decision in
Sunilakhya Chowdhury v HM Jadwet,30. wherein it was held that the words "makes or
publishes any imputation" should be interpreted as words supplementing each other. A
maker of imputation without publication is not liable to be punished under section 499.
The same interpretation is warranted in respect of the words "makes, publishes or
circulates" in section 505 (IPC, 1860) also.
19. Section 505 renumbered as sub-section (1) of that section by Act 35 of 1969, section 3
(w.e.f. 4 September 1969).

Royal Indian Marine occurring after the words Majesty were omitted by Act 35 of 1934, section
2 and Sch.
23. Ins. by Act 35 of 1969, section 3(i) (w.e.f. 4 September 1969).
24. Subs. by Act 41 of 1961, section 4, for two years (w.e.f. 12 September 1961).
