Abetment of a thing.
A person abets the doing of a thing, who—
First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or
Secondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for
the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that
conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or
Thirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of
a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or
attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that
thing.
ILLUSTRATION
A, a public officer is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z. B,
knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and
thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the
apprehension of C.
Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act,
does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates
the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.
COMMENTS.—
In common parlance, the word 'abet' means assistance, co-operation and
encouragement and includes wrongful purpose. In Corpus Juris Secundum, vol I at p
306, the meaning of the word 'abet' is given as follows:
'To abet' has been defined as meaning to aid; to assist or to give aid; to command, to
procure, or to counsel; to countenance; to encourage, counsel, induce, or assist; to
encourage or to set another on to commit.
Used with 'aid'. The word 'abet' is generally used with the word 'aid' and similar words.
In order to bring a person abetting the doing of a thing, under any one of the clauses
enumerated under section 107, it is not only necessary to prove that the person who
has abetted has taken part in the steps of the transactions but also in some way or
other he has been connected with those steps of the transactions which are criminal.
The offence of abetment depends upon the intention of the person who abets, and not
upon the act which is actually done by the person whom he abets.1.
For the purposes of the first two clauses of this section it is immaterial whether the
person instigated commits the offence or not or the persons conspiring together
actually carry out the object of the conspiracy.2. It is only in the case of a person
abetting an offence by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the
charge of abetment against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to
have committed the offence is acquitted of that offence.3. The Court noted that in
Faguna Kanta Nath v State of Assam4. the appellant was tried for an offence under
section 165A for having abetted the commission of an offence by an officer, who was
acquitted, and it was held that the appellant's conviction for abetment was also not
maintainable. But subsequently in Jamuna Singh v State of Bihar,5. it was considered
not desirable to hold that an abettor cannot be punished if the person actually
committing the offence is acquitted. The Court said that the abettor's guilt depends
upon the nature of the offence abetted and the manner of abetment. It is only in cases
of intentional aiding that the abettor would have to be acquitted with the principal
offender.6. Following this state of the rulings the Supreme Court ordered the acquittal
of the single abettor when the main offender as also all other abettors already stood
acquitted.
The Supreme Court has reiterated that before anybody can be punished for abetment
of suicide, it must be proved that the death in question was a suicidal death.7.
The Supreme Court held that the offence of abetment is a separate and independent
offence. Where the offence is committed in consequence of the abetment but there is
no provision for punishment of such abetment, the abettor is to be punished along with
the offender for the original offence.8.
Abetment is constituted by:
(1) instigating a person to commit an offence; or
(2) engaging in a conspiracy to commit it; or
(3) intentionally aiding a person to commit it.
The offence of abetment by instigation depends upon the intention of the person who
abets and not upon the act which is done by the person who has abetted. The
abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid as provided under section
107, Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860. However, the words uttered in a fit of anger or
omission without any intention cannot be termed as instigation.9.
[s 107.1] Mens rea.—
In order to proceed against a person for criminal offence under section 107,
prosecution must prove the element of mens rea. Negligence or carelessness or the
facilitation cannot be termed to be abetment so as to punish the guilty as per the
provision of penal laws.10. In order to constitute abetment, the abettor must be shown
to have "intentionally" aided to commission of the crime. Mere proof, that the crime
charged could not have been committed without involvement and/or interposition of
the alleged abettor is not enough compliance with the requirements of section 107. It is
not enough that an act on the part of the alleged abettor happens to facilitate the
commission of the crime. Intentional aiding and therefore active complicity is the gist
of the offence of abetment under the third paragraph of section 107.11.
[s 107.2] Sting operation, mens rea and abetment.—
In typical sting operations, though the operation is carried in the public interest, the
same is generally done by instigating the accused. Hence the victim, who is otherwise
innocent, is lured into committing a crime on the assurance of absolute secrecy and
confidentiality of the transaction raising the potential question as to how such a victim
can be held responsible for the crime which he would not have committed but for the
enticement. In such circumstances, should the individual, i.e., the sting operator be held
criminally liable for commission of the offence that is inherent and inseparable from
the process by which commission of another offence is sought to be established?
What about the operator who has mens rea or guilty intention to commit the offence?
These are puzzling questions when there is an allegation that the sting operator is
alleged to have committed the abetment of the offence. The Supreme Court in Rajat
Prasad v CBI,12. observed that a crime does not stand obliterated or extinguished
merely because its commission is claimed to be in public interest. At the same time,
the criminal intent (mens rea) behind the commission of the act will have to be
established before the liability of the person charged with the commission of crime can
be adjudged. The Court held that the questions whether the sting operation is a
journalistic exercise and any criminal intent can be imputed are to be answered by the
evidence of the parties.
(1) Abetment by instigation.—First clause.—A person is said to 'instigate' another to an
act, when he actively suggests or stimulates him to the act by any means of language,
direct or indirect, whether it takes the form of express solicitation, or of hints,
insinuation or encouragement.13.
[s 107.3] "Instigate" Meaning.—
Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do "an act". To
satisfy the requirement of "instigation", though it is not necessary that actual words
must be used to that effect or what constitutes "instigation" must necessarily and
specifically be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the
consequence must be capable of being spelt out. Where the accused had, by his acts
or omission or by a continued course of conduct, created such circumstances that the
deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide, in which case,
"instigation" may have to be inferred. A word uttered in a fit of anger or emotion without
intending the consequences to actually follow, cannot be said to be instigation. Thus, to
constitute 'instigation', a person who instigates another has to provoke, incite, urge or
encourage the doing of an act by the other by "goading" or 'urging forward'. The
dictionary meaning of the word "goad" is "a thing that stimulates someone into action;
provoke to action or reaction … to keep irritating or annoying somebody until he
reacts".14. The word "instigate" literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about
by persuasion to do anything. The abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or
intentional aid as provided in the three clauses of the section.15. Instigate means the
active role played by a person with a view to stimulate another person to do the thing.
In order to hold a person guilty of abetting it must be established that he had
intentionally done something which amounted to instigating another to do a thing.16.
Instigation may be of an unknown person.17. A mere acquiescence or permission does
not amount to instigation.18.
[s 107.4] Wilful misrepresentation or wilful concealment.—
Explanation 1 to this section says that a person who (1) by wilful misrepresentation, or
(2) by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily
causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure a thing to be done, is said to
instigate the doing of that thing. The illustration is an example of instigation by 'wilful
misrepresentation'. Instigation by 'wilful concealment' is where some duty exists which
obliges a person to disclose a fact. The explanation to section 107 says that any wilful
misrepresentation or wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to
disclose, may also come within the contours of "abetment".19.
[s 107.5] CASES.—Direct instigation.—
Where, of several persons constituting an unlawful assembly, some only were armed
with sticks, and A, one of them, was not so armed, but picked up a stick and used it, B
(the master of A), who gave a general order to beat, was held guilty of abetting the
assault made by them.20.
[s 107.6] Suicide.—
Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a
person in doing a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or
aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.21. Deceased committed
suicide by hanging himself because of alleged illicit relationship between his wife and
the accused. Accused took the wife of deceased away from the house of her brother
and kept her with him for four days. There is definitely a proximity and nexus between
the conduct and behaviour of the accused and wife of deceased with that of suicide
committed by the deceased.22. Where a married girl committed suicide by burning
herself in her in-law's house, her in-laws were held guilty of abetment because they
were persistently torturing her for inadequate dowry and had gone to the extent of
accusing her of illegitimate pregnancy.23. "All these tortures and taunts", Ray J said,24.
"Caused depression in her mind and drove her to take the extreme step of putting an
end to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on her person and setting it afire." In another
case of the same kind a husband persistently demanded more money from his wife,
quarrelling with her everyday. On the fateful day when she happened to say that death
would have been better than this, she heard only this in reply that her husband would
feel relieved if she ended her life. Immediately thereafter she set herself on fire. The
husband was held guilty of instigating her to commit suicide.25. Mere harassment of
wife by husband due to differences per se does not attract section 306 read with
section 107, IPC, 1860.26.
Demand of loan amount by accused from deceased itself does not come within the
scope of abetment as defined under section 107.27. Goading and intimidating a debtor
with a view to pressurising him for repayment of the loan which brought about a
suicide by the debtor immediately thereafter, was held as not amounting to abetment
of suicide and, therefore, no case under section 306 read with section 34 was made
out.28.
The accused told the other person "to go and die". It was held that this would not in
itself satisfy the ingredients of instigation. Instigation has to be with mens rea. The
suicide was committed two days after the quarrel between the accused and the
deceased. This also showed that the suicide was not the direct result of the quarrel.
The suicide note indicated that her husband was a frustrated man and given to drinking
and suffered from great stress and depression.29.
The accused, a Motor Vehicle Inspector, beat up and abused a driver for not being able
to produce necessary papers. The driver committed suicide. The Court said that it was
not shown that he was guilty of any act of abetment within the meaning of section 107.
The charge against him under section 107 was quashed.30.
[s 107.7] Proof.—
In Chitresh Kumar Chopra v State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi),31. the Supreme Court
reiterated the legal position laid down in its earlier three judge bench judgment in the
case of Ramesh Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh,32. and held that where the accused by
his acts or continued course of conduct creates such circumstances that the deceased
was left with no other option except to commit suicide, an instigation may be inferred.
In order to prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to
be established that:
(i) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds or wilful
omission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the deceased
reacted or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words or wilful omission
or conduct to make the deceased move forward more quickly in a forward
direction; and
(ii) that the accused had the intention to provoke urge or encourage the deceased
to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above. Undoubtedly,
presence of mens rea is the necessary concomitant of instigation.33.
[s 107.8] Threats.—
Mere threats of involving the family in a false and frivolous case cannot be held to
tantamount to instigation. By such threats it cannot be held that the accused instigated
the deceased to commit suicide.34.
[s 107.9] Test.—
No straight-jacket formula can be laid down to find out as to whether in a particular
case there has been instigation which force the person to commit suicide. In a
particular case, there may not be direct evidence in regard to instigation which may
have direct nexus to suicide. Therefore, in such a case, an inference has to be drawn
from the circumstances and it is to be determined whether circumstances had been
such which in fact had created the situation that a person felt totally frustrated and
committed suicide.35.
(2) Abetment by conspiracy.—Second clause.—'Conspiracy' consists in the agreement
of two or more [persons] to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means.
So long as such a design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to
carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the parties,
promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced, if lawful, is
punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of criminal means.36. It is not
necessary that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it.
It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is
committed.37. Where parties concert together, and have a common object, the act of
one of the parties, done in furtherance of the common object and in pursuance of the
concerted plan, is the act of all.38.
Before the introduction of Chapter V-A, conspiracy, except in cases provided for by
sections 121A, 311, 400, 401 and 402 of the Code, was a mere species of abetment
when an act or an illegal omission took place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and
amounted to a distinct offence for each distinct offence abetted by conspiracy.39. For
an offence under the second clause of this section a mere combination of persons or
agreement is not enough; an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of
the conspiracy. But for an offence under section 120A a mere agreement is enough if
the agreement is to commit an offence.40.
[s 107.10] Abetment and Conspiracy-Difference between.—
Criminal conspiracy postulates an agreement between two or more persons to do, or
cause to be done, an illegal act or an act which is not illegal, by illegal, means. It differs
from other offences because mere agreement is made an offence even if no step is
taken to carry out that agreement. Though there is close association of conspiracy with
incitement and abetment the substantive offence of criminal conspiracy is somewhat
wider in amplitude than abetment by conspiracy as contemplated under section 107,
IPC, 1860.41. There is no analogy between section 120B and section 109, IPC, 1860.
There may be an element of abetment in a conspiracy, but conspiracy is something
more than an abetment. Offences created by sections 109 and 120B, iPC, 1860 are
quite distinct and there is no warrant for limiting the prosecution to only one element of
conspiracy, that is, abetment when the allegation is that what a person did was
something over and above that.42.
(3) Abetment by aid.—Third clause.—By act.—A person, it is trite, abets by aiding, when
by any act done either prior to, or at the time of the commission of an act, he intends to
facilitate and does in fact facilitate the commission thereof, would attract the third
clause of section 107 of the IPC, 1860. Doing something for the offender is not
abetment. Doing something with knowledge so as to facilitate him to commit the crime
or otherwise would constitute abetment.43. In order to constitute abetment by aiding
within the meaning of the third paragraph of section 107, IPC, 1860 the abettor must be
shown to have intentionally aided the commission of the crime. A person may invite
another casually or for a friendly purpose and that may facilitate the murder of the
invitee. But unless it is shown that the invitation was extended with a view to facilitate
the commission of the murder, it cannot be said that the person extending the
invitation had abetted the murder. The language used in the section is "intentionally
aids" and therefore, active complicity is the gist of the offence of abetment under the
third paragraph of section 107, IPC, 1860.44. Abetment includes instigating any person
to do a thing or engaging with one or more persons in any conspiracy for the doing of a
thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy and in
order to the doing of that thing, or intentional aid by any act or illegal omission to the
doing of that thing. On facts held, in the instant case, there was no direct evidence to
establish that the appellant either aided or instigated the deceased to commit suicide
or entered into any conspiracy to aid her in committing suicide.45. Where the principal
offender killed the victim with a knife provided by the defendant who later claimed that
he thought the knife would be used only to threaten, the defendant's conviction for
murder was upheld, the Court of Appeal saying that the trial judge was correct to direct
the jury that the defendant could be so convicted if he contemplated that the principal
offender might kill or cause serious bodily harm to the victim as part of their joint
enterprise.46. It is not necessary that the abettor should be present at the place of the
occurrence. It is also not necessary to show that the secondary party to a conspiracy to
murder intended the victim to be killed provided it is proved that he contemplated or
foresaw the event as a real or substantial risk. Mere absence from the scene of the
crime cannot amount to unequivocal communication of withdrawal from the
enterprise. The accused was recruited with certain others by a person to kill his wife. At
a predetermined time she was taken to the agreed place and killed. The accused was
not present when the killing took place. It was held that he was rightly convicted in that
he had lent encouragement and assistance before the commission of the crime.47.
[s 107.11] By illegal omission.—
The definition of abetment as given in section 107, IPC, 1860 not only includes
instigation but also intentional aiding by an illegal omission.48. A lady advocate was
attending the chamber of her senior advocate, the accused. On the day of the incident
she was talking with the accused at her residence. At that moment in his presence, she
poured kerosene on her and set herself on fire. The accused did nothing to save her. It
was held that this did not amount to "illegal omission". He was held not guilty of
abetment of suicide.49.
[s 107.12] Abetment of offences under other laws.—
The offence of aiding and abetting is applicable to all statutory offences unless
specifically excluded by statute and accordingly it was held to apply to offences
created by the [English] Public Order Act, 1986.50. An abetment of an offence under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 can be made by a non-public servant. Abettors are
to be prosecuted through trial under the Prevention of Corruption Act.51.
[s 107.13] CASES.—By act.—Presence at bigamous marriage.—
Mere presence at the scene of a bigamous marriage without any evidence of
instigation aiding or conspiring would not amount to abetment.52. Where the accused
held the antarpat (screen) during the performance of a marriage which he knew was a
void marriage under section 494, it was held that his act amounted to an act of
intentional aid and fell within the purview of the explanation.53.
[s 107.14] Presence at exhibition of blue film.—
While entering into the parlour the accused was not aware of the type of film under
exhibition. Immediately after his entry, the police raided the parlour and charge-sheeted
him as an abettor of offences under sections 292, 293 and 294 because blue films
were under exhibition. Following the Supreme Court decision in Shri Ram v State of
UP,54. the Court held that something more must be shown than mere presence.
[s 107.15] Rape-Abetment.—
In a case of custodial rape, husband and wife, taken into police custody, were kept in
separate rooms. The wife was raped by the head constable while the accused
constable kept watch over the husband and did nothing hearing the shrieks of the
victim wife. Conviction of the accused constable for abetting commission of rape was
upheld.55.
[s 107.16] Humiliation.—
The accused persons caused constant humiliation to the deceased by accusing him of
theft of things belonging to relatives at a marriage occasion. He committed suicide
after returning from marriage. The humiliation caused by the accused was held to be
not such as to amount to instigation which could have induced the deceased to
commit suicide.56.
[s 107.17] Attempt.—
Merely because the section opens with the words "if any person commits suicide" it
cannot be held that in a case of unsuccessful suicide there is no attempt to abet the
commission of suicide. Suicide and its attempt on the one hand and abetment of
commission of suicide and its attempt on the other are treated differently by law and
therefore, the one who abets the commission of an unsuccessful attempt to commit
suicide cannot be held to be punishable merely under section 309 read with section
116, IPC, 1860. To implement the scheme of law he has got to be held to be punishable
under section 306 read with section 511, IPC, 1860. The Supreme Court has never laid
down in Satvir Singh57. that under no circumstance an offence under section 306 read
with section 511, IPC, 1860 can be committed. The Supreme Court did not have
occasion to consider whether a conviction for an offence of attempt to abet the
commission of suicide is punishable under section 306 read with section 511, IPC,
1860.58.
