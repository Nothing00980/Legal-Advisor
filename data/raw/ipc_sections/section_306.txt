Punishment for murder by life convict.
Whoever, being under sentence of 316.[imprisonment for life], commits murder, shall
be punished with death.
COMMENT.â€”
This section has been struck down by the Supreme Court as void and unconstitutional
being violative of both Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. It regards life convict to
be a dangerous class without any scientific basis and, thus, violates Article 14 and
similarly by completely cutting out judicial discretion it becomes a law which is not just,
fair and reasonable within the meaning of Article 21.317. So all murders are punishable
under section 302, IPC, 1860. For the same reasons, Supreme Court declared section
27(3) of Arms Act 1959, ultra vires the Constitution. It was held that by imposing
mandatory death penalty, section 27(3) of the Arms Act, 1959 runs contrary to those
statutory safeguards which give judiciary the discretion in the matter imposing death
penalty. Section 27(3) of the Act is thus ultra vires the concept of judicial review which
is one of the basic features of our Constitution.318.
316. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, section 117 and Sch., for "transportation for life" (w.e.f. 1-1-1956).

participating co-accused found guilty by virtue of section 34 converted into life imprisonment. A
prosecution under section 302 for causing death by a motor vehicle is not a bar to a civil claim
arising out of the same accident. The civil proceeding is not likely to prejudice the position of
the accused in the criminal proceeding. Raja Ram Garg v Chhanga Singh, AIR 1992 All 28 [LNIND
