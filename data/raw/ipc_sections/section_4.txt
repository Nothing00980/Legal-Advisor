COMMENT—
This section shows the extent to which the Code applies to offences committed
outside India. The Code applies to any offence committed by—
(1) any citizen of India in any place, wherever he may be;
(2) any person on any ship or aircraft registered in India wherever it may be; and
(3) any person, whether or not a citizen of India, who commits any offence, from
anywhere in the world, targeting a computer resource located in India.
Hence, except for the case of an offence committed against a computer resource
located in India, to extend the scope of operation of IPC, 1860 against persons, either
the offender must be a citizen of India or he must have committed the offence on any
ship or aircraft registered in India.
[s 4.1] Crimes committed outside India.—
Where an offence is committed beyond the limits of India but the offender is found
within its limits, then
(I) he may be given up for trial in the country where the offence was committed
(extradition) or
(II) he may be tried in India (extraterritorial jurisdiction).
Where an offence was committed by an Indian citizen outside India, it was held that the
offence was punishable under the IPC, 1860. An investigation of such an offence would
not require sanction of the Central Government under the proviso to section 188, Cr PC,
1973. But an enquiry as contemplated by section 202, Cr PC, 1973 could only be with
the sanction of the Central Government.55.
(I) Extradition.—Extradition is the surrender by one State to another of a person desired
to be dealt with for crimes of which he has been accused or convicted and which are
justiciable in the Courts of the other State. Surrender of a person within the State to
another State—whether a citizen or an alien—is a political act done in pursuance of a
treaty or an arrangement ad hoc.56. Though extradition is granted in implementation of
the international commitment of the State, the procedure to be followed by the Courts
in deciding, whether extradition should be granted and on what terms, is determined by
the municipal law of the land. Extradition is founded on the broad principle that it is in
the interest of civilised communities that criminals should not go unpunished and on
that account, it is recognised as a part of the comity of nations that one State should
ordinarily afford to another State assistance towards bringing offenders to justice.57.
The procedure for securing the extradition from India is laid down in the Extradition Act,
1962.
(II) Extraterritorial jurisdiction.—Indian Courts are empowered to try offences
committed out of India on (A) land, (B) high seas or (C) aircraft.
(A) Land.—By virtue of sections 3 and 4 of the Penal Code, and section 188 of the Cr
PC, 1973 local Courts can take cognizance of offences committed beyond the
territories of India. Where the Court is dealing with an act committed outside India by a
citizen of India which would be an offence punishable under the Penal Code if it had
been committed in India, section 4 constitutes the act an offence and it can be dealt
with under section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973.58. If, however, at the time of commission of
the offence the accused person is not a citizen of India, the provisions of section 4 of
the Penal Code and section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973 have no application.59.
Section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973, provides that when an offence is committed outside
India—
(a) by a citizen of India, whether on high seas or elsewhere; or
(b) by any person not being such citizen on any ship or aircraft registered in India,
he may be dealt with in respect of such offence as if it had been committed at
any place within India at which he may be found.
The word 'found' in section 188, Cr PC, 1973 means not where a person is discovered
but where he is actually present.60. A man brought to a place against his will can be
said to be found there.61. When a man is in the country and is charged before a
Magistrate with an offence under the Penal Code, it will not avail him to say that he was
brought there illegally from a foreign country. The Bombay High Court has laid down
this principle, following English precedents, in Savarkar's case.62. The accused Savarkar
had escaped at Mareseilles from the custody of police officers charged with the duty of
bringing him from London to Bombay, but was re-arrested there and brought to Bombay
and committed for trial by the Special Magistrate at Nasik. The High Court held that the
trial and committal were valid.63. The provisions of the IPC, 1860 have been extended
to offences committed by any citizen of India in any place within and beyond India by
virtue of section 4 thereof. Accordingly, offences committed in Botswana by an Indian
citizen would also be amenable to the provisions of the IPC, 1860 subject to the
limitation imposed under the proviso to section 188 Cr PC, 1973.64. Section 4 gives
extraterritorial jurisdiction but as the Explanation says the acts committed must
amount to an offence under the Penal Code.65.
[s 4.2] Acts done within Indian as well as foreign territory.—
A person who is a citizen of India is liable to be tried by the Courts of this country for
acts done by him, partly within and partly without the Indian territories, provided the
acts amount together to an offence under the Code.66.
(B) Admiralty jurisdiction.—The jurisdiction to try offences committed on the high seas
is known as the admiralty jurisdiction. It is founded on the principle that a ship on the
high seas is a floating island belonging to the nation whose flag she is flying.
Admiralty jurisdiction extends over—
(1) Offences committed on Indian ships on the high seas.
(2) Offences committed on foreign ships in Indian territorial waters.
(3) Piracy.
Power to enforce claims against foreign ships is an essential attribute of admiralty
jurisdiction and it is assumed over such ships while they are within the jurisdiction of
the High Court by arresting and detaining them. Admiralty jurisdiction of the High
Courts in India has been historically traced to the Charters of 1774 and 1728, as
subsequently expanded and clarified by the Letters Patent of 1823, 1862 and 1865 read
with the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, and the
Colonial Court of Admiralty (India) Act, 1891 and preserved by section 106 of the
Government of India Act, 1915, section 223 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and
Article 225 of the Constitution of India. The pre-Constitution enactments have
continued to remain in force in India as existing laws.67.
The High Court as a Court of Admiralty is treated as a separate entity exercising a
distinct and specific or prescribed or limited jurisdiction. This reasoning is based on the
assumption that the continuance in force of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890
as an existing law carves out a distinct jurisdiction of the High Court limited in ambit
and efficacy to what has been granted by the Admiralty Court Act 1861, and that
jurisdiction has remained stultified ever since. This restrictive construction is not
warranted by the provisions of the Constitution. Accordingly, a foreign ship falls within
the jurisdiction of the High Court where the vessel happens to be at the relevant time,
i.e., at the time when the jurisdiction of the High Court is invoked, or, where the cause of
action wholly or in part arises. The Merchant Shipping Act empowers the concerned
High Court to arrest a ship in respect of a substantive right. This jurisdiction can be
assumed by the concerned High Court, whether or not the defendant resides or carries
on business, or the cause of action arose wholly or in part, within the local limits of its
jurisdiction. Once a foreign ship is arrested within the local limits of the jurisdiction of
the High Court, and the owner of the ship has entered appearance and furnished
security to the satisfaction of the High Court for the release of the ship, the
proceedings continue as a personal action. The conclusion is that all the High Courts in
India have inherent admiralty jurisdiction and can invoke the same for the enforcement
of a maritime claim.68.
Even while exercising extraordinary powers available under the Constitution the
jurisdiction of the High Court is primarily circumscribed by its territorial limits, viz., the
jurisdiction has to be in context of the territorial jurisdiction available to the High Court.
If the overall scheme of IPC, 1860 (section 4), Cr PC, 1973 (section 188), The Merchant
Shipping Act, 1958 (section 437) and the Territorial Waters Act, 1976 (section 13) are
taken into consideration read with sections 2(2) and 3(15) of the Merchant Shipping
Act, it is apparent that for a Court, including High Court, to be vested with jurisdiction,
an offender or offending vessel have to be found within local territorial limits of such
Court.69.
[s 4.3] Piracy
Piracy consists of any of the following acts:
(a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for
private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft,
and directed:
(i) on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or
property on board such ship or aircraft;
(ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the
jurisdiction of any State;
(b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with
knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;
(c) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in
subparagraph (a) or (b).70.
The Convention on the Law of Sea known as United National Convention on the Law of
Sea, 1982 (UNCLOS) sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and
armed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities. UNCLOS, 1982 is a
comprehensive code on the international law of sea. It codifies and consolidates the
traditional law within a single, unificatory legal framework. It has changed the legal
concept of continental shelf and also introduced a new maritime zone known as
exclusive economic zone. Exclusive economic zone is a new concept having several
new features.71. The UNCLOS signed by India in 1982 and ratified on 29 June 1995,
encapsulates the law of the sea and is supplemented by several subsequent
resolutions adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations.
Before UNCLOS came into existence, the law relating to the seas which was in
operation in India, was the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic
Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 1976, which spelt out the jurisdiction of the
Central Government over the Territorial Waters, the Contiguous Zones and the
Exclusive Economic Zone. The provisions of the UNCLOS are in harmony with and not
in conflict with the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, in this regard. Article 33
of the Convention recognises and describes the Contiguous Zone of a nation to extend
to 24 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
measured. Similarly, Articles 56 and 57 describe the rights, jurisdiction and duties of
the coastal State in the Exclusive Economic Zone and the breadth thereof extending to
20 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
measured. This provision is also in consonance with the provisions of the 1976 Act.
The area of difference between the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, and the
Convention occurs in Article 97 of the Convention which relates to the penal
jurisdiction in matters of collision or any other incident of navigation.72.
[s 4.4] Jurisdiction of Indian High Courts.—
In view of the declaration of law made by the Supreme Court in M V Elisabeth v Harwan
Investment and Trading,73. the High Courts in India have inherent admiralty jurisdiction.
The offences which come within the admiralty jurisdiction are now defined by the
Merchant Shipping Act, 1958.
(C) Aircraft.—The provisions of the Code are made applicable to any offence
committed by any person on any aircraft registered in India, wherever it may be.
[s 4.5] Liability of foreigners in India for offences committed outside its limits.
—
The acts of a foreigner committed by him in territory beyond the limits of India do not
constitute an offence against the Penal Code, and, consequently, a foreigner cannot be
held criminally responsible under that Code by the tribunals of India for acts committed
by him beyond its territorial limits. Thus, when it is sought to punish a person, who is
not an Indian subject, as an offender in respect of a certain act, the question is not
'where was the act committed,' but 'was that person at the time, when the act was
done, within the territory of India'. For, if he was not, the act is not an offence, the doer
of it is not liable to be punished as an offender, and he is, therefore, not subject to the
jurisdiction of criminal Courts.74. But if a foreigner in a foreign territory initiates an
offence which is completed within Indian territory, he is, if found within Indian territory,
liable to be tried by the Indian Court within whose jurisdiction the offence was
completed.75.
[s 4.6] Section 4 IPC and section 188 of Cr PC.—
Section 188 Cr PC, 1973 and section 4 of the IPC, 1860 spell out that if the person
committing the offence at that point of time is a citizen of India, then, even if the
offence is committed beyond the contours of India, he will be subject to the jurisdiction
of the Courts in India. The rule enunciated under the two sections rests on the principle
that qua citizens the jurisdiction of Courts is not lost by reason of the venue of the
offence. However, section 188 of the Code places an interdiction in the enquiry or trial
over offences committed outside India by a citizen of India insisting for sanction from
the Central Government to do so.76.
