Amount of fine.
Where no sum is expressed to which a fine may extend, the amount of fine to which
the offender is liable is unlimited, but shall not be excessive.
COMMENT—
A fine is fixed with due regard to circumstances of the case in which it is imposed and
the condition of life of the offender. When the legislature has not fixed any upper limit
for the quantum of fine in respect of a particular offence, the Court has freedom to fix
any amount but then the Court must see that the fine imposed is not excessively high
or repulsively low. Financial capacity of the accused, enormity of the offence and extent
of damage caused to the victim of the offences etc. are relevant considerations in
fixing up the amount.187.
[s 63.1] Fine not to be harsh or excessive.—
The general principle of law running through sections 63 to 70 is that the amount of
fine should not be too harsh or excessive. Where a substantial term of imprisonment is
inflicted, an excessive fine should not be imposed except in exceptional cases.188.
Section 63 does not prescribe any limit to the amount of fine, but it should not be
excessive. In the present case having regard to the gravity of the offence and the illegal
gains made by the accused, the fine imposed to the tune of Rs. 60 crores was held to
be not excessive.189.
[s 63.2] Applicability in other Statutes.—
Sections 63–70 IPC, 1860 and provision of Cr PC, 1973 relating to the award of
imprisonment in default of payment of fine would apply to all cases wherein fines have
been imposed on an offender unless 'the Act, Regulation, Rules or Bye-law contains an
express provision to the contrary'.190.
