(2)
If the value  of the papers in any such parcel is equal to the quota the papers shall be set aside as finally dealt with.

If the value of the papers in any such parcels is greater than the quota, the surplus shall be transferred  to the continuing candidates, indicated on the ballot-papers as next in the order of the voter's preference, in the manner prescribed in the following regulation.

(2)
While  determining  the candidates highest on the poll, if two or more candidates have equal value of votes, regard shall be had to the values of votes the earliest count at which the candidates in question had unequal values of votes, and the candidate or candidates with the lowest value of votes shall be excluded from the poll and if the value of votes be equal at all counts, the [Chief Commissioner, Gurdwara Elections]

 shall decide according to the terms of Regulations XVII which shall first be dealt with.

If the surplus of any candidate to be transferred arises from original votes only, the [Chief Commissioner, Gurdwara Elections] 
[See Government of India Notification GSR 279(E) dt. 22.6.1979 P. 25.]
 shall examine all the papers in the parcel belonging to the candidate whose surplus is to be transferred and divide the unexhausted paper into the sub-parcels according to the next available  preferences recorded thereon.  He shall also make a separate sub-parcel of the exhausted paper.
(b)
He shall ascertain the number and value of the papers in each sub-parcel and of all the unexhausted papers.
(c)
If the value of the unexhausted papers is equal to or less than the surplus, he shall transfer all the unexhausted papers at the value at which they were received by the candidate whose surplus is being transferred.
(d)
If the value of the unexhausted papers is greater than the surplus, he shall transfer the sub-parcels of unexhausted papers; and the value at which each paper shall be transferred, shall be ascertained by dividing the surplus by the total number of unexhausted papers.
(5)
If the surplus of any candidate to be transferred arises from transferred as well as original votes,  the [Chief Commissioner, Gurdwara Elections] 
[See Government of India Notification GSR 279(E) dt. 22.6.1979 P. 25.]
  shall re-examine all the papers in the sub-parcel last transfered to the candidate and divide the unexhausted papers into sub-parcels according to the next available preferences recorded thereon, and shall make a separate sub-parcel of the exhausted papers.

(6)
The papers transferred to each candidate shall be added in the form of a sub-parcel to the papers already belonging to such candidates.
(7)
All papers in the parcel or sub-parcels of an elected candidate not transferred under this regulation shall be set aside as finally dealt with.
XIII.  (1)  If after all surpluses have been transferred, as hereinbefore directed less than the number of candidates required have been elected, the [Chief Commissioner, Gurdwara Elections] 
[See Government of India Notification GSR 279(E) dt. 22.6.1979 P. 25.]
 shall exclude from the poll the candidate lowest on the poll and shall distribute his unexhausted papers among the continuing  candidate according to the next available preferences recorded thereon.  Any exhausted papers shall be set aside as finally dealt with.
(2)
The papers containing original votes of an excluded candidate shall first be transfered, the transfer value of each paper being one hundred.
(3)
The papers containing transferred votes of an excluded candidate shall then be transferred in the order of the transfers in which and at the value at which he obtained them.
(4)
The transfer of each such parcel or sub-parcel shall be deemed to be a separate transfer, but not  a separate count.
(5)
If a result of transfer of papers under these regulations, the value of the votes obtained by a candidate is equal to or greater than the quota, the transfer of the parcel or sub-parcel then proceeding shall be completed but no further papers shall be transferred to him.
XIV.  The process directed by the preceding regulation shall be repeated on the successive exclusions one after another of the candidates lowest on the poll until the vacancy is filled either by the election of a candidate with the quota or as hereinafter provided.
XV. (1)  If after the completion of any transfer under these regulations the value of the votes of any candidate is equal to or greater than the quota, he shall be treated as elected, provided his election does not contravene the provisions of sub-rule (2) of rule 12.
(2)
If the value of the votes of any such candidate is equal to the quota, the whole of the papers on which such votes are recorded shall be set aside as finally dealt with.
(3)
If the value of the votes of any such candidate is greater than the quota, his surplus shall be distributed in the manner hereinafter provided, before the exclusion of any other candidate.
(4)
If the value of the votes of a candidate is equal to or greater than the quota, and his election infringes the provision of sub-rule (2) of rule 12, that candidate shall not be declared elected but shall be excluded from the poll and his votes shall be transferred to the remaining continuing candidates in accordance with the next available preferences indicated thereon and at the value at which he received them.
XVI. (1)  When the number of continuing candidates is reduced to the number of vacancies remaining unfilled, all the continuing candidates shall be treated as elected subject to the provision of sub-rule (2) of rule 12.
(2)
When only one vacancy remains unfilled, and the value of the votes of some one continuing  candidate exceeds the total value of all the votes of the other continuing candidates, together with any surplus not transferred, that candidate shall be treated as elected and no further transfer shall be made.
(3)
When only one vacancy remains unfilled and there are only two continuing candidates and these two candidates have each the same value of votes and no surplus remains capable of transfer, one candidate shall be declared excluded under the next succeeding regulation and the other shall be treated as elected.
XVII. (1) If when there is more than one surplus to distribute, two or more surpluses are equal, the surplus of the candidate  having the greatest value of votes at the earliest count at which the candidates in question had unequal values of votes, shall be first distributed.
(2)
If, at any time it becomes necessary to exclude a candidate and two or more candidates have the same values of votes and are lowest on the poll, regard shall be had to the original votes of each candidate, and the candidate with the smallest value of original votes shall be first excluded.
(3)
If the values of their original votes are equal, the candidate with the smallest value at the earliest count  at which these candidates had unequal values shall be first excluded. If two or more candidates are lowest on the poll and each has the same values of votes at all counts, the [Chief Commissioner, Gurdwara Elections] 
[See Government of India Notification GSR 279(E) dt. 22.6.1979 P. 25.]
 shall decide by lot which candidate shall be first excluded.

[Substituted for the words 'Election Commissioner' by Punjab Act No. 22 of 1957, section 2.]
 shall write the name of the candidates, concerned on similar slips of paper and the slips having been folded so as to prevent recognition and mixed and drawn at random, the candidate or candidates shall, in cases of exclusion, be excluded in the order in which their names are drawn, and in cases of surpluses, the surpluses shall be transferred in the order in which the names are drawn.
