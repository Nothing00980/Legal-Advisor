Acts against which there is no right of private defence.
There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause
the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by a
public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act, may not
be strictly justifiable by law.
There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause

direction of a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that
direction may not be strictly justifiable by law.
There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to

it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.
Explanation 1.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an
act done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows
or has reason to believe, that the person doing the act is such public servant.
Explanation 2.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an
act done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he
knows, or has reason to believe, that the person doing the act is acting by such

has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded.
COMMENT.—
This section indicates the limits within which the right of private defence should be
exercised.
[s 99.1] First clause.—
This clause applies to those cases in which the public servant is acting in good faith
under colour of his office, though the particular act being done by him may not be
justifiable by law.405. Where officers of Delhi Municipal Corporation acting in good faith
by virtue of powers delegated to them by the Commissioner attempted to seize the
buffalo of the accused with a view to recover arrears of milk tax, the mere fact that no
prior notice was issued to the accused as required by the Municipal Act would not
make their act entirely outside the law and as such accused had no private defence
under section 99 of the Code. The officers had merely erred in exercise of their
powers.406. The clause applies to a case where an official has done wrongly, what he
might have done rightly, but not to cases where the act could not have been done
rightly at all by the official concerned.407. The clause applies where a public servant
acts irregularly in the exercise of his powers, and not where he acts outside the scope
of his powers.408. Where a police officer acting bona fide under colour of his office
arrests a person but without authority, the person so arrested has no right of self-
defence against the officer.409. If the act of a public servant is ultra vires the right of
private defence may be exercised against him.410. A police-officer, holding a search,
without a written authority, cannot be said to be acting 'under colour of his office'.411.
[s 99.2] CASES.—Resistance to officer acting without warrant.—
A police-officer attempted without a search-warrant to enter a house in search of
property alleged to have been stolen and was obstructed and resisted. It was held that,
even though the officer was not strictly justified in searching the house without a
warrant, the person obstructing and resisting could not set up the illegality of the
officer's proceeding as a justification of his obstruction, as it was not shown that the
officer was acting otherwise than in good faith and without malice.412. Where a raiding
party organized by the official of the Municipal Corporation to round up stray cattle
within the limits of the Corporation, was attacked when it had rounded up some cattle
and was leading the cattle to the cattle pound, it was held that the act of the raiding
party was fully justifiable by law and that the accused had no right of private
defence.413. Where a party was fired at to dispel them from their attempt to rescue
their friend from an illegal police detention, it was held that this was sufficient to cause
reasonable apprehension in their mind of death or grievous injury.414.
[s 99.3] Illegal attachment does not justify resistance.—
Where articles protected from attachment were attached, it was held that this act did
not justify resistance.415. Where the property of a person was wrongfully attached as
the property of certain absconders, it was held that the rightful owner had no right of
private defence of his property, as the police-officer was acting in good faith under
colour of his office, and that even supposing the order of attachment might not have
been properly made, that would in itself not be sufficient ground for such a defence.416.
[s 99.4] Second clause.—
The first clause speaks of acts done by a public servant, this clause, of acts done under
the direction of a public servant. It is not necessary that the doer should be a public
servant. Explanation 2 must be read conjointly with this clause.
[s 99.5] CASE.—Resistance to execution of warrant.—
Where a police-officer attempted to execute a warrant the issue of which was illegal, it
was held that the accused were justified in their resistance.417.
[s 99.6] Third clause.—
The third clause of this section must be read with the first clause of section 105.418. It
places an important restriction on the exercise of the right of defence. The right of
private defence being granted for defence only, it must not and cannot legally be
exercised when there is time to have recourse to the protection of public authorities.
The right of private defence does not take the place of the functions of those public
servants who are especially charged with the protection of life and property and the
apprehension of offenders, and where the assistance of the public authorities can be
procured, the right cannot be lawfully exercised. But the law does not intend that a
person must run away to have recourse to the protection of public authorities when he
is attacked instead of defending himself.419. A person in possession cannot be
expected to leave his property at the mercy of armed trespassers. Where there is
imminent danger to the property and the person in possession apprehends substantial
damage thereto, he is entitled to raise his own arms in defence and retaliate to keep
away the attack without applying for State aid.420. Where the accused was in rightful
possession of the property by virtue of a Court order; under section 145 Cr PC, 1973, he
had every right to throw out the complainant party from the land and demolish the
construction stealthily put up thereon.421. The important considerations which always
arise in order to determine whether the action of the accused is covered by the right of
private defence are, first, what is the nature of the apprehended danger, and, second,
whether there was time to have recourse to the police authorities, always remembering
that when both the parties are determined to fight and go up to the land fully armed in
full expectation of an armed conflict in order to have a trial of strength the right of
private defence disappears.422.
[s 99.7] CASES.—Time to obtain protection of public authorities.—
The accused received information one evening that the complainants intended to go on
his land on the following day, and uproot the corn sown in it. At about three o'clock next
morning he was informed that the complainants had entered on his land and were
ploughing up the corn. Thereupon he at once proceeded to the spot, followed by the
remaining accused, and remonstrated with the complainants, who commenced an
attack on the accused. In the fight which ensued, both sides received serious injuries,
and the leader of the complainants' party was killed. It was held that the complainants
being the aggressors, the accused had the right of private defence and that they were
not bound to act on the information received on the previous evening and seek the
protection of the public authorities, as they had no reason to apprehend a night attack
on their property.423. In a case involving an old land dispute, one party (accused)
offered resistance to prevent the other from ploughing the land and on refusal went up
to the place where the other was sitting without arms and inflicted stick blows causing
death, it was held that the accused was rightly convicted. The Court said that a rightful
owner can defend his possession against any attempt to dislodge him, but that once a
trespasser has established his foothold; resort should be had to public authorities.424.
The right of private defence does not extend to inflicting of more harm than necessary
for the purpose of defence. The prosecution party, in this case, had gone to plough the
land which was in the possession of the accused (appellant). The latter had time to go
and report the matter to appropriate authorities constituted under the law. But instead
of so doing, they brutally attacked the other party resulting in the death of three
persons. Thus, there was no right of private defence. It was held that there was no
warrant for converting the conviction from u/section 302 to section 304 Part II.425.
[s 99.8] Fourth clause.—
The right of private defence is restricted to not inflicting more harm than it is necessary
to inflict for the purpose of defence. The amount of force necessarily depends on the
circumstances of the case, and there is no protection if the harm is caused by
excessive violence quite unnecessary to the case.426. For example, a person set by his
master to watch a garden or yard is not at all justified in shooting at, or injuring in any
way, persons who may come into those premises, even in the night. He ought first to
see whether he could not take measures for their apprehension.427. The measure of
self-defence must always be proportionate to the quantum of force used by the
attacker and which it is necessary to repel.428. In dealing with the question as to
whether more force is used than is necessary or than was justified by the prevailing
circumstances, it would be inappropriate to adopt tests of detached objectivity of a
Court room. The means which a threatened person adopts or the force which he uses
should not be weighed in golden scales.429. Though a person exercising his right of
private defence is not expected to modulate his defence step by step or tier by tier, yet
it is necessary to see that it is not totally disproportionate to the injury sought to be
averted, e.g., to ward off a slap one cannot fire a gun. Thus, where the father of the
accused was allegedly assaulted with lathis which resulted in simple injuries, the
accused was not justified in firing his gun and thereby killing the attacker. In such a
case it could not be said that there was a reasonable apprehension of death or
grievous hurt within the meaning of clause (1) of section 100, IPC, 1860.430. But at the
same time it should also be remembered that if a man has real justification to exercise
his right of private defence, he cannot be held liable if he slightly exceeds his right of
private defence, e.g., where face to face with a murderous attack he fires two shots in
quick succession, for these things cannot be weighed in golden scales.431. The right of
private defence should not be allowed to be pleaded or availed of as pretext for a
vindictive, aggressive or retributive purpose.432.
[s 99.9] CASES.—Justifiable harm.—
A party attempted to rescue a friend from unlawful police detention. Three rounds were
fired to dispel them. This caused in their mind a reasonable apprehension of death or
injury. They tried to snatch the police gun. A police informer intervened and died of
injuries received in the process. The right of private defence was held to be not
exceeded.433. In another case the Supreme Court accepted the defence version that
there were four assailants who had come well prepared to assault at the door of their
house. In such a situation accused persons could have a reasonable apprehension of
death or at least of grievous hurt. It was a case of single gunshot which was not
repeated. Therefore, it cannot be said that the accused persons had exceeded their
right of private defence in any manner.434.
In view of the fact that the accused was pursued, that he only picked up the weapon
when he was chased and that he used it only once, his sentence was reduced to three
years and nine months.435.
[s 99.10] Attack on unarmed persons.—
No right of private defence can exist against an unarmed and unoffending
individual;436. where the injury was caused to the victim on the vital parts of the body
even though he and the witnesses present at the spot were all unarmed, it was held
that the question of acting in self-defence did not arise.437.
[s 99.11] Sudden quarrel.—
The right of private defence was held to be not available where the incident of lathi
blows causing death took place in the course of a sudden fight.438.
[s 99.12] More harm caused than necessary.—
Where a person killed a weak old woman found stealing at night,439. where a person
caught a thief in his house at night and deliberately killed him with a pick-axe to prevent
his escape;440. where a number of persons apprehending a thief committing house-
breaking strangled him and subjected him to gross maltreatment when he was fully in
their power,441. and where a heavy and mechanically propelled vehicle like a jeep was
used as a means or weapon for the exercise of the right of private defence,442. the right
of private defence was negatived.443. Where the injuries suffered by the accused were
of simple nature than those caused by him to the deceased persons and he went even
to the extent of preventing a witness from carrying the victim to a hospital, it was held
that the accused was an aggressor and was, therefore, not entitled to the right of
private defence.444. Where, on the other hand, two drunk and armed raiders demanded
money from the residents of a flat and in face to face with the inmates who resisted
them, lost their lives, it being not known which inmate played what role, the Supreme
Court held that it could not be said that more harm was caused than was
necessary.445. Where the accused caused death in order to repel an attack by a party
armed with lethal weapons and which had already caused injuries to the accused, it
was held that the accused did not exceed his rights as it was not possible for him to
have weighed in golden scales in the heat of the moment the number of injuries
required to overcome the attack.446. Where the accused continued to assault the
deceased even after he fell to the ground, the possibility of causing injuries in exercise
of his right of private defence was ruled out.447.
Where the accused received an injury on his neck first, the right of private defence was
held to have arisen. But it was shown that three injuries were caused in return one of
them entering deep into the chest and causing death. The right of private defence was
held to have been exceeded. The conviction was modified to one under section
304(1).448.
