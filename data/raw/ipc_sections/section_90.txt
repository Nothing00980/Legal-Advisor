Act of a child under seven years of age.
Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age.
COMMENT.â€”
Under the age of seven years no infant can be guilty of a crime; for, under that age an
infant is, by presumption of law, doli incapax, and cannot be endowed with any
discretion. If the accused were a child under seven years of age, the proof of that fact
would be ipso facto an answer to the prosecution.78. It is, therefore, desirable to bring
some evidence regarding the age of the accused on the record.79.
The accused purchased for one anna, from a child aged six years, two pieces of cloth
valued at 15 annas, which the child had taken from the house of a third person. It was
held that, assuming that a charge of an offence of dishonest reception of property
(section 411) could not be sustained owing to the incapacity of the child to commit an
offence, the accused was guilty of criminal misappropriation, if he knew that the
property belonged to the child's guardians and dishonestly appropriated it to his own
use.80.
