Cohabitation caused by a man deceitfully inducing a belief of lawful
marriage.
Every man who by deceit causes any woman who is not lawfully married to him to
believe that she is lawfully married to him and to cohabit or have sexual intercourse
with him in that belief, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.—
Upon perusal of section 493 of the IPC, 1860 to establish that a person has committed
an offence under the said section, it must be established that a person had deceitfully
induced a belief to a woman, who is not lawfully married to him, that she is a lawfully
married wife of that person and thereupon she should cohabit or should have had
sexual intercourse with that person. Looking at the afore-stated section, it is clear that
the accused must induce a woman, who is not lawfully married to him, to believe that
he is married to her and as a result of the afore-stated representation, the woman
should believe that she was lawfully married to him and there should be cohabitation or
sexual intercourse as a result of the deception. The essence of an offence under
section 493 IPC, 1860 is, therefore, practice of deception by a man on a woman as a
consequence of which the woman is led to believe that she is lawfully married to him
although she is not and then make her cohabit with him.1. The offence under this
section may also be punished as rape under section 375, clause (4).2.
[s 493.1] Ingredients.—
The section contains two ingredients:—
(1) Deceit causing a false belief in the existence of a lawful marriage.
(2) Cohabitation or sexual intercourse with the person causing such belief.
[s 493.2] Proof of marriage.—
Section 493 IPC, 1860 do not presuppose a marriage between the accused and the
victim necessarily by following a ritual or marriage by customary ceremony. What has
been clearly laid down and emphasised is that there should be an inducement of belief
in the woman that she is lawfully married to the accused/ appellant and the
inducement of belief of a lawful marriage cannot be interpreted so as to mean or infer
that the marriage necessarily had to be in accordance with any custom or ritual or
under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. If the evidence on record indicate inducement of
a belief in any manner in the woman which cannot possibly be enlisted but from which
it can reasonably be inferred by ordinary prudence that she is a lawfully married wife of
the man accused of an offence under section 493 IPC, 1860 the same will have to be
treated as sufficient material to bring home the guilt under section 493 IPC, 1860.
Interpretation of the section in any other manner including an assertion that the
marriage should have been performed by customary rituals or in similar manner only in
order to establish that a belief of marriage had been induced, is bound to frustrate the
very object and purpose of the provision for which it has been incorporated in the IPC,
1860 which is clearly to prevent the deceitful act of a man inducing the belief of a
lawful marriage for the purpose of cohabitation merely to satisfy his lust for sexual
pleasure.3.
Where a man and woman exchanged garlands, the man promising to marry formally,
and had sex as a result of which the woman became pregnant, it was held that the
exchange of garlands did not amount to falsely inducing the woman to believe that she
was married to the man. Section 493 was not attracted.4. Where a woman married a
man with full knowledge that he was already a married man and there was no proof
that the man falsely induced her to believe anything, it was held that the ingredients of
the offence under section 493 were not made out.5.
[s 493.3] Rape and section 493.—
In a case, the complainant made the allegation of fraud played by the petitioner by
suppressing the fact of earlier marriage and the alleged physical relationship were
under a belief that she was a legally wedded wife of the petitioner. The Court held that
a bare perusal of provision of sections 493 and 495 of IPC, 1860 shows that the bodily
relationship or sexual intercourse by a husband with his second wife falls under the
category of offence under sections 493 and 495 of IPC, 1860 and it cannot be treated
as rape as defined in section 375 of IPC, 1860. It is an independent offence, the
cognizance of which can be taken by the Court on the basis of complaint filed by the
complainant herself, therefore, the offence punishable under section 376 of IPC, 1860
is not made out as the alleged act of sexual intercourse by the petitioner with the
complainant may fall within the category of sections 493 and 495 of IPC, 1860 but not
in the category of rape as defined in section 375 of IPC, 1860 and made punishable
under section 376 of IPC; therefore, the cognizance of section 376 of IPC, 1860 is
against the settled principles of law.6.
[s 493.4] Cohabitation during the operation of divorce decree, set aside later.—
The fact that the marriage between the appellant and the respondent was dissolved by
an ex parte decree and while that order was in force, the respondent husband
continued sexual relationship with the appellant, until he married another woman.
Subsequently the ex parte decree was set aside by the Court. The Supreme Court held
that the allegation that there was deception on the part of the husband for having
sexual relationship and that constituted an offence under section 493 of IPC, 1860
would not arise for the reason that there was subsistence of valid marriage during this
period as the ex parte decree was set aside later.7.

the accused and prosecutrix were in love with each other for several years. The accused married
another and still continued to cohabit with the prosecutrix on false pretences of marrying her.
The prosecutrix was aware of this fact. Hence, there was no deception. Framing of charge
against the accused was not proper. Mana Begum v Jula Mohd, 1998 Cr LJ 3244 (Ori), evidence
of the victim that the accused on promise to marry her had sex with her. The court said that
ingredients of the offence under s 493 were not made out.
