Unnatural offences.
Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man,
woman or animal, shall be punished with 1265.[imprisonment for life], or with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.—Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary
to the offence described in this section.
COMMENT.—
This section was intended to punish the offence of sodomy, buggery and bestiality. The
offence purported to consist in a carnal knowledge committed against the order of
nature by a person with a man, or in the same unnatural manner with a woman, or by a
man or woman in any manner with an animal. To attract the above offence, the
following ingredients were required: 1) Carnal intercourse and 2) against the order of
nature.
[s 377.1] Constitutionality of section 377.—Naz Judgment.—
The Delhi High Court in a landmark judgment declared section 377 IPC, 1860
unconstitutional, insofar it criminalised consensual sexual acts of adults in private as
violative of Articles 21, 14 and 15 of the Constitution.1266. But in Suresh Kumar Koushal
v NAZ Foundation,1267. the Supreme Court overruled the Delhi High Court judgment
holding that those who indulge in carnal intercourse in the ordinary course and those
who indulge in carnal intercourse against the order of nature constitute different
classes and the people falling in the latter category cannot claim that section 377
suffers from the vice of arbitrariness and irrational classification. What section 377
does is merely to define the particular offence and prescribe punishment for the same
which can be awarded if in the trial conducted in accordance with the provisions of the
Cr PC, 1973 and other statutes of the same family the person is found guilty. Therefore,
section 377 IPC, 1860 was held to be not ultra vires Articles 14 and 15 of the
Constitution. It was also observed by the Supreme Court that the Court merely
pronounced on the correctness of the view taken by the Delhi High Court on the
constitutionality of section 377 IPC, 1860 and found that the said section did not suffer
from any constitutional infirmity. Notwithstanding this verdict, the competent
legislature shall be free to consider the desirability and propriety of deleting section
377 IPC, 1860 from the statute book or amend the same.
A constitution bench of the Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar v UOI,1268. overruled
Suresh Kumar Koushal and held that consensual carnal intercourse among adults in
private space, does not in any way harm public decency or morality. Therefore, section
377 in its present form violates Article 19(1)(a). The court held that so far as section
377 penalises any consensual sexual relationship between two adults, be it
homosexuals (man and man), heterosexuals (man and woman) or lesbians (woman
and woman), cannot be regarded as constitutional. However, if anyone engages in any
kind of sexual activity with animal, said aspect of section 377 is constitutional and it
shall remain a penal offence. The court held that any act of description covered under
section 377 done between two individuals without consent of any one of them would
invite penal liability. Further, non-consensual acts which have been criminalised by
virtue of section 377 have already been designated as penal offences under section
375 and under POCSO Act, 2012.
[s 377.2] Section 375 not subject to section 377.—
In Navtej Singh Johar v UOI,1269. the Supreme Court further held that section 375 gives
due recognition to absence of 'wilful and informed consent' for act to be termed as
rape, per contra, section 377 which does not contain any such qualification. Section
375, as substituted by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, does not use words
'subject to any other provision of IPC' which indicates that section 375 is not subject to
section 377. Criminalisation of carnal intercourse between two adults was held legally
unsustainable.
[s 377.3] Penetration.—
The explanation states that penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse
necessary to the offence of rape. Section 377 of IPC, 1860 presupposes carnal
intercourse against the order of nature.1270. As in rape so also in an unnatural offence
even the slightest degree of penetration is enough and it is not necessary to prove the
completion of the intercourse by the emission of seed.1271.
In a case arising out of unnatural offence, it was held that the acts alleged against the
accused falling into two categories (1) sexual intercourse per OS (mouth) and (2)
manipulation and movement of penis of the accused whilst being held by the victims in
such a way as to create orifice like thing for making manipulated movement of
insertion and withdrawal till ejaculation of semen, fell within the sweep of unnatural
carnal offences and quashing of proceedings was not warranted.1272.
The victim girl aged seven years was in the care and custody of the accused and the
offences were committed by him over a period of time. Medical evidence and DNA
profile conclusively established commission of natural and unnatural sexual acts on
the deceased by the accused. Imposition of the maximum punishment awardable for
the said offences, i.e., life imprisonment was held perfectly justified.1273.
[s 377.4] Anal intercourse—Sodomy, medical evidence.—
When an expert categorically ruled out the commission of an unnatural offence having
regard to his expertise, it was obligatory on the part of the prosecution to draw his
attention so as to enable him to furnish an explanation. It was contended that
lacerations are likely to disappear if the examination is made after two to three days
and nature of injuries would also depend upon several factors. The doctor in his
evidence stated that the tissues around the anus are hard and rough. At the time of
answering the calls of nature, the extra skin will be expanded. Immediately after it will
come to original status. By examination it was found that the boy was not habitually
used for anal intercourse. If there is continuous act of intercourse for about a week or
even two, three days it can be found out as to whether he had any intercourse or not. It
may be true that absence of medical evidence by itself is not a crucial factor in all
cases, but, the same has to be taken into consideration as a relevant factor when other
evidence points towards the innocence of the appellant. It was not a case where only
one view was possible. It is a well-settled principle of law that where two views are
possible, the High Court would not ordinarily interfere with the judgment of
acquittal.1274.
[s 377.5] Conviction without charge.—
Though medical evidence shows that victim was subjected to rape and carnal
intercourse on more than one occasion before she was murdered, there was no charge
of sodomy under section 377 IPC, 1860 framed by trial Court. It was held that accused
cannot be convicted under section 377.1275.
