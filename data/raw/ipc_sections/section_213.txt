Fraudulently obtaining decree for sum not due.
Whoever fraudulently obtains 1 a decree or order against any person for a sum not
due or for a larger sum than is due, or for any property or interest in property to which
he is not entitled, or fraudulently causes a decree or order to be executed against any
person after it has been satisfied 2 or for anything in respect of which it has been
satisfied or fraudulently suffers or permits any such act to be done in his name, shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
two years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This section is the counterpart to section 208 in respect of fraudulent decrees, just as
section 207 is the counterpart to section 206 in respect of fraudulent transfers and
conveyances, the object of the Code being to strike both parties alike with the same
penalty. This section, taken together with section 208, will enable both plaintiff and
defendant to a fraudulent or collusive suit or execution to be dealt with alike.
1. 'Obtains'.—The offence is committed when the decree is fraudulently obtained and
the fact that the decree has not been set aside, though admissible to prove that there
was no fraud, is not a bar to a prosecution under the section.218.
2. 'Causes a decree or order to be executed...after it has been satisfied'.—The mere
presentation of an application for the execution of a decree already executed will not
be sufficient. The accused must have caused the decree to be executed against the
opposite party after it had been satisfied;219. or obtained an order for attachment for a
sum already paid.220. Where the decree-holder does not want to proceed with the
execution and gets his execution application dismissed he cannot be convicted of an
offence under this section.221.
The fact that the satisfaction is of such a nature that the Court executing the decree
could not recognize it does not prevent the decree-holder from being convicted of an
offence under this section.222.
