COMMENT.—
To establish an offence under this section it must be proved that the person charged
with the offence had the intention at the time of the kidnapping or abduction that the
person kidnapped or abducted will be murdered or so disposed of as to be put in
danger of being murdered.1089. The Supreme Court stated the ingredients to be: (1)
kidnapping by the accused must be proved; (2) it must also be proved that the person
in question was kidnapped in order, (a) that he may be murdered, or (b) that he might
be disposed of in such manner as to be put in danger of being murdered.1090.
When it was not proved that kidnapping was with intention to commit murder of victim
boy, it was held that conviction of appellant under section 363 of IPC, 1860 is proper
though charge against accused was framed under section 364 IPC, 1860.1091.
[s 364.1] Presumption of killing by abductors.—
An abducted victim was murdered later on. It was held that the Court can, depending
on the factual situation, draw the presumption that the abductors are responsible for
the murder. It is their responsibility to explain to the Court what they had done with the
victim.1092. The facts of the case showed that the parties were inimically disposed
against each other. The presence of the accused at the place of occurrence was also
established. They picked up the person and bodily lifted him away. They fired in the air
to ward off resistance. The abducted person was not seen or heard of since 27 years.
Section 108 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 applied to create presumption of death. In
the face of such death, whether actual or presumptive, the inference of murder by
abductors arises. The Court said that it would not be necessary to prove corpus delicit.
The offence under the section was made out.1093. Where abduction of the victim was
proved and the victim was found murdered soon after abduction, the Supreme Court
said that it was for the accused to satisfy the Court as to how the abducted victim was
dealt with. In the absence of any such explanation, the Court may draw the
presumption that the abductor was murderer also.1094.

MP v Mahesh Mohan Lal Mali, 1990 Cr LJ 2483 , of the two accused, evidence that child
kidnapped and killed was last seen with one of them and this fact along with his extra-judicial
confession, was sufficient for conviction, but the bare confession of the other accused not
sufficient. State of MP v Amar Singh, AIR 1994 SC 650 : 1994 Cr LJ 619 , witnesses not
implicating the accused of abduction or murder, evidence not sufficient to prove the guilt of the
accused, acquittal affirmed. Pankaj Naik v State of Orissa, 1994 Cr LJ 829 (Ori), kidnapped child
deposing the story, admits tutoring, his evidence not trustworthy, medical evidence
contradictory, conviction not sustainable. Arumugham v State of TN, 1994 Cr LJ 520 (Mad),
where the accused was prosecuted for abducting a girl and killing her and the extra-judicial
confession of the accused and the alleged cause of death by throttling were not proved by the
oral and medical evidence, it was held that accused was entitled to acquittal.

AIR 2005 SC 2345 [LNIND 2005 SC 486] : (2005) 11 SCC 133 [LNIND 2005 SC 486] , prosecution
proceeded on footing that there eyewitnesses to the fact of murder, hence section 106, Indian
Evidence Act, 1872 (burden on the abductor to show what happened to the abducted person)
did not apply. Conviction under section 364 maintained but that under sections 302/34 set
aside.
