Public servant, disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any
person.
Whoever, being a public servant, knowingly disobeys any direction of the law as to the
way in which he is to conduct himself as such public servant, intending to cause, or
knowing it to be likely that he will, by such disobedience, cause injury to any person,
shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year,
or with fine, or with both.
ILLUSTRATION
A, being an officer directed by law to take property in execution, in order to satisfy a
decree pronounced in Z's favour by a Court of Justice, knowingly disobeys that
direction of law, with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause injury to Z. A has
committed the offence defined in this section.
COMMENT—
Disobedience of law by public servant.—The offence under this section consists in a
wilful departure from the direction of the law, intending to cause injury to any person.
Mere breach of departmental rules will not bring a public servant within the purview of
this section.
[s 166.1] Ingredients.—
(i) The accused was a public servant at the relevant time;
(ii) There was a direction of law as to how such public servant should conduct
himself;
(iii) The accused had disobeyed such direction;
(iv) By such disobedience he had intended to cause or knew it would likely cause
injury to any person.
The indispensable ingredient of the offence is that the offender should have done the
act "being a public servant". The next ingredient close to its heels is that such public
servant has acted in disobedience of any legal direction concerning the way in which
he should have conducted as such public servant. For the offences under sections 167
and 219 of IPC, 1860 the pivotal ingredient is the same as for the offence under section
166 of IPC, 1860.1. If in carrying out the direction of law the accused gave information
which according to the complainant was untrue, that by itself cannot attract the
offence punishable under section 166 IPC, 1860 unless it is shown that the replies
given by the accused were untrue.2. Where an investigating officer recorded his
satisfaction in writing that the search of a particular premises was necessary because
disputed documents might be found there, his entry into such premises was held to be
not in disobedience of law and therefore, he could not be prosecuted without sanction
under section 197 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC, 1973).3. To make out an
offence under this provision, it has to be stated that the public servant knowingly
disobeyed any particular direction of the law which he was bound to obey and further
that such disobedience would cause injury to any person to the knowledge of the
public servant.
