Whoever, being a public servant, legally bound as such public servant to apprehend or
to keep in confinement any person under sentence of a Court of Justice for any
offence 340.[or lawfully committed to custody], intentionally omits to apprehend such
person, or intentionally suffers such person to escape or intentionally aids such
person in escaping or attempting to escape from such confinement, shall be punished
as follows, that is to say:—
with 341.[imprisonment for life] or with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to fourteen years, with or without fine, if the person in confinement,
or who ought to have been apprehended, is under sentence of death; or
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years,
with or without fine, if the person in confinement, or who ought to have been
apprehended, is subject, by a sentence of a Court of Justice, or by virtue of a
commutation of such sentence, to 342.[imprisonment for life] 343.[***] 344.[***] 345.
[***] 346.[***] or imprisonment for a term of ten years or upwards; or
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or
with fine, or with both, if the person in confinement, or who ought to have been
apprehended is subject, by a sentence of a Court of Justice, to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding to ten years [or if the person was lawfully committed to custody].
COMMENT.—
This section is similar to the last section with the exception that the person to be
apprehended has already been convicted or committed for an offence. It is thus an
aggravated form of the offence made punishable by the last section.
