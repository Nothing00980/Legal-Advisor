"Counterfeit.".
A person is said to "counterfeit" who causes one thing to resemble another thing,
intending by means of that resemblance to practise deception, or knowing it to be
likely that deception will thereby be practised.
144. [Explanation 1.—It is not essential to counterfeiting that the imitation should be
exact.
Explanation 2.—When a person causes one thing to resemble another thing, and the
resemblance is such that a person might be deceived thereby, it shall be presumed,
until the contrary is proved, that the person so causing the one thing to resemble the
other thing intended by means of that resemblance to practise deception or knew it to
be likely that deception would thereby be practised.]
COMMENT—
The aforesaid definition states that imitation is not required to be exact. It also says
that it is not necessary that counterfeit note should be made with primary intention of
its being looked as genuine. It is sufficient if resemblance to genuine currency note is
so caused that it is capable to being passed as such.145. In order to apply section 28,
what the Court has to see is whether one thing is made to resemble another thing and
if that is so and if the resemblance is such that a person might be deceived by it, there
will be a presumption of the necessary intention or knowledge to make the thing
counterfeit, unless the contrary is proved. The difference between the counterfeit and
the original is not therefore, limited to a difference existing only by reason of faulty
reproduction.146. The main ingredients of counterfeiting as laid down in section 28,
IPC, 1860, are:
(i) causing one thing to resemble another thing,
(ii) intending by means of such resemblance to practice deception, or
(iii) knowing it to be likely that deception will thereby be practised.
There can be counterfeiting even though the imitation is not exact and there are
differences in detail between the original and the imitation so long as the resemblance
is so close that deception may thereby be practised. And if the resemblance is such
that a person might be deceived thereby, it shall be presumed until the contrary is
proved that the person causing one thing to resemble another thing was intending by
means of that resemblance to practise deception or knew it to be likely that deception
would thereby be practised.147.
The word 'counterfeit' occurs in offences relating to coin provided in Chapter XII and
offences relating to property marks and currency notes in Chapter XVIII.
If coins are made to resemble genuine coins and the intention of the makers is merely
to use them in order to foist a false case upon their enemies, those coins do not come
within the definition of counterfeit coins.148. The prosecution must establish that the
coins manufactured resemble the original. It must also establish that there is an
intention to deceive, or the knowledge that deception would be caused by such
resemblance.149.
[s 28.1] Foreign Currency.—
The Supreme Court has observed that the word "counterfeit" has been defined in this
provision in very wide terms and the same has been further supplemented by the
Explanation which draws an adverse inference against the maker of the counterfeit
matter. There being no restriction as to the subject-matter of the offence, quite
obviously the offence of imitating a foreign currency would be within the scope of the
expression.150.
