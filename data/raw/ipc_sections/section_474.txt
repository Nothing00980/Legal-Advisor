COMMENTS.â€”
The definition of 'forgery' in section 463, Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) is very
wide. The basic elements of forgery are: (i) the making of a false document or part of it;
and (ii) such making should be with such intention as is specified in the section, viz., (a)
to cause damage or injury to (i) the public, or (ii) any person, or (b) to support any claim
or title, or (c) to cause any person to part with property, or (d) to cause any person to
enter into an express or implied contract, or (e) to commit fraud or that fraud may be
committed.2. If a document, which is not genuine, is being used as such and a person
is made to part with money on that basis then not only the offence of cheating as
defined under section 415 IPC but also the offence of forgery as defined under section
463 IPC is attracted.3.
