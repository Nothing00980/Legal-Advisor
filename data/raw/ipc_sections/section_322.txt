Hurt.
Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to cause hurt.
COMMENT.—
The authors of the Code say:
Many of the offences which fall under the head of hurt will also fall under the head of
assault. A stab, a blow which fractures a limb, the flinging of boiling water over a person, are
assaults, and are also acts which cause bodily hurt. But bodily hurt may be caused by many
acts which are not assaults. A person, for example, who mixes a deleterious potion, and
places it on the table of another; a person who conceals a scythe in the grass on which
another is in the habit of walking; a person who digs a pit in a public path, intending that
another may fall into it, may cause serious hurt, and may be justly punished for causing
such hurt; but they cannot, without extreme violence to language, be said to have committed
assaults. We propose to designate all pain, disease and infirmity by the name of hurt.712.
The definition of hurt appears to contemplate the causing of pain, etc., by one person
to another. Pulling a woman by the hair was held to be this offence.713.
[s 319.1] Act neither intended nor likely to cause death is hurt even though
death is caused.—
Where there is no intention to cause death nor knowledge that death is likely to be
caused from the harm inflicted, and death is caused, the accused would be guilty of
hurt only if the injury caused was not serious. Where the accused with a view to
chastising her daughter, eight or 10 years old, for impertinence, gave her a kick on the
back and two slaps on the face, the result of which was death, it was held that she was
guilty of voluntarily causing hurt.714. Where in course of a sudden quarrel the accused
hit his friend on his head with a stick weighing only 210 grams which unfortunately
proved fatal, it was held that no knowledge of death could be ascribed to him. His
conviction was accordingly changed to one under section 323, IPC, 1860.715.
[s 319.2] Poisoned sweetmeats.—
A boy of about 16 years of age, being in love with a girl some three or four years
younger, and apparently intending to administer to her something in the nature of a love
philtre, induced another boy younger than himself to give the girl some sweetmeats.
The girl and some of the other members of her family ate the sweetmeats and all the
persons who partook of them were seized with more or less violent symptoms of
dhatura poisoning, though none of them died. It was held that the boy was guilty of
causing hurt.716.

whether the hurt in question is of one category or the other. The medical evidence is only an
opinion to help the court to formulate its own opinion. Hadia Mia v State of Assam, 1988 Cr LJ

was ignored. The injuries caused to the victim by the constable's beating were not visible.
