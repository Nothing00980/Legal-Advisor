16-5-1962).
In its application to the whole State of Orissa, in Section 292, for the words, "which may
extend to three months", substitute the words "which may extend to two years" and

Tamil Nadu.— The following amendments were made by Tamil Nadu Act No. 25 of 1960,
s. 2 (w.e.f. 9-11-1960).
In its application to the whole of the State of Tamil Nadu, in Section 292, for the words
"shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend
to three months or with fine or with both", substitute the following, namely:—
"shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend

COMMENT.—
section 292 IPC, 1860, was enacted by the Obscene Publications Act to give effect to
Article I of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation of and
Traffic in Obscene Publications to which India is a signatory. By Act 36 of 1969, section
292 was amended to give more precise meaning to the word 'obscene' as used in the
section in addition to creating an exception for publication of matter which is proved to
be justified as being for the public good, being in the interest of science, literature, art
or learning or other objects of general concern. Prior to its amendment, section 292
contained no definition of obscenity. The amendment also literally does not provide for
a definition of 'obscenity' in as much as it introduces a deeming provision.108. In order
to make the law relating to the publication of obscene matters or objects deterrent, the
section provides for enhanced punishment. The Exception to the original section, which
is now redrafted, exempts from the provisions of the section any representation,
sculptured, engraved or painted on or in any ancient monument. The possession
referred to in this section connotes conscious possession.109. By Act 25 of 1960, the
State of Tamil Nadu has added a new section as section 292A for dealing with printing,
of grossly indecent or scurrilous matter or matter intended for blackmail. The State of
Orissa has followed suit by Act 13 of 1962. The intention of the Legislature while
amending the provision is to deal with this type of offences which corrupt the mind of
the people to whom objectionable things can easily reach and need not be emphasized
that corrupting influence is more likely to be upon the younger generation who has got
to be protected from being easy prey.110. This section was amended by Act XXXVI
when apart from enlarging the scope of the exceptions, the penalty was enhanced
which was earlier up to three months or with fine or with both. By the amendment a
dichotomy of penal treatment was introduced for dealing with the first offenders and
the subsequent offenders. In the case of even a first conviction, the accused shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two
years and with fine which may extend to Rs 2,000.111.
1. 'Obscene'.—The word obscenity is not defined in the IPC, 1860. The word 'obscene'
was originally used to describe anything disgusting, repulsive, filthy or foul. The use of
the word is now said to be somewhat archaic or poetic; and it is ordinarily restricted to
something offensive to modesty or decency, or expressing or suggesting unchaste or
lustful ideas, or being impure, indecent, or lewd.112. The obscene matter in a book must
be considered by itself and separately to find out whether it is so gross and its
obscenity, so decided, that it is likely to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are
open to influences of this sort and into whose hands the book is likely to fall. In this
connection, the interests of our contemporary society and particularly the influence of
the book on it must not be overlooked.113. It was further observed in this case that
merely treating with sex and nudity in art and literature cannot be regarded as evidence
of obscenity without something more. It was held that where obscenity and art are
mixed, art must be so preponderating as to throw the obscenity into the shadow or the
obscenity so trivial and insignificant that it can have no effect and may be overlooked.
When treatment of sex becomes offensive to public decency and morality as judged by
the prevailing standards of morality in the society, then only the work may be regarded
as an obscene production.114. In considering the question of obscenity of a publication
what the Court has to see is that whether a class, not an isolated case, into whose
hands the book, article or story falls suffer in their moral outlook or become depraved
by reading it or might have impure and lecherous thoughts aroused in their minds.115. It
was also observed in this case that the question of obscenity may have to be judged in
the light of the claim that the work has a predominant literary merit. Referring to the
impact on the mind of the youth, the Court said:116.
We do not think that it can be said with any assurance that merely because the adolescent
youth read situations of the type presented in the book, they would become deprived,
debased and encouraged to lasciviousness. It is possible that they may come across such
situations in life and may have to face them. But if a narration or description of a similar
situation is given in a setting emphasising a strong moral to be drawn from it and condemns
the conduct of the erring party as wrong and loathsome, it cannot be said that they have a
likelihood of corrupting the morals of, those in whose hands it is likely to fall—particularly
the adolescent.
In KA Abbas v UOI,117. the Supreme Court has called the test laid down in Mishkin's
case118. as 'selective audience obscenity test' and observed as:
our standards must be so framed that we are not reduced to a level where the protection of
the least capable and the most depraved amongst us determines what the morally healthy
cannot view or read ….
The requirements of art and literature include within themselves a comprehensive view of
social life and not only in its ideal form and the line is to be drawn where the average moral
man begins to feel embarrassed or disgusted at a naked portrayal of life without the
redeeming touch of art or genius or social value. If the depraved begins to see in these
things more than what an average person would, in much the same way, as it is wrongly
said, a Frenchman sees a woman's legs in everything, it cannot be helped. In our scheme of
things ideas having redeeming social or artistic value must also have importance and
protection for their growth.
In the case of Samaresh Bose v Amal Mitra119. wherein the Supreme Court provided the
following guidance:120.
In our opinion, in judging the question of obscenity, the judge in the first place should try to
place himself in the position of the author and from the view point of the author the judge
should try to understand what is it that the author seeks to convey and what the author
conveys has any literary and artistic value. The judge should thereafter place himself in the
position of a reader of every age group in whose hands the book is likely to fall and should
try to appreciate what kind of possible influence the book is likely to have in the minds of
the readers. The judge should thereafter apply his judicial mind dispassionately to decide
whether the book in question can be said to be obscene within the meaning of the section
by an objective assessment of the book as a whole and also of the passages complained of
as obscene separately.
It is no defence to a charge of obscenity merely to urge that the information has been
copied from similar works.121.
In Promilla Kapur (Dr) v Yash Pal Bhasin, Promilla Kapur (Dr) v Yash Pal Bhasin,122. the
Delhi High Court felt123. that there was nothing wrong if a sociologist made a research
on the subject of call-girls in order to know the reasons as to why and how the young
girls fall in this profession and what society could do in order to eradicate or at least
minimise the possibility of young budding girls joining the flesh trade. The book was in
the form of interviews with the girls in the profession. The portion marked by the
Magistrate as obscene was a description of their encounters with unscrupulous males
including a description by some girls of their first experience with sex. But by far the
bulk of the book dealt with the ways and means of running the profession and the
methods of encountering them. Thus, the book was within the scope of clause (a) of
the first exception. In Bobby Art International v Om Pal Singh Hoon,124. while examining
the validity of certificate of exhibition awarded to the film "Bandit Queen" it was held
that nakedness does not always arouse the baser instinct. In Director General,
Directorate General of Doordarshan v Anand Patwardhan,125. the Supreme Court again
referred to the Hicklin test and observed that the relevant questions are:
(a) whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would
find that the work, taken as a whole appeal to the prurient interest.
(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual
conduct specifically, defined by the applicable state law,
(c) whether the work taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
In the case of Ajay Goswami v UOI,126. the Supreme Court, while recognizing the right of
adult entertainment, reviewed the position of law on obscenity and summarized the
various tests laid down regarding obscenity.
[s 292.1] A picture of a woman in the nude is not per se obscene.—
Unless the picture of a nude/semi-nude female is an incentive to sensuality or impure
or excite the thoughts in the mind of an ordinary person of normal temperament, the
pictures cannot be regarded as obscene within the meaning of section 292 IPC, 1860.
But where repetitive photographs without any backdrop content are published in a
magazine and nearly l/4th of the magazine consists of nothing but repetitive
photographs of semi-nude women, prominence being to display their breast, there
being hardly any literary contents in the magazine, the matter loses any literary content
and therefore the broad social outlook penned in Ranjit Udeshi's case127. may not be
available as a defence.128. To fall within the scope of 'obscene' under sections 292 and
294 IPC, the ingredients of the impugned matter/art must lie at the extreme end of the
spectrum of the offensive matter. The legal test of obscenity is satisfied only when the
impugned art/matter can be said to appeal to an unhealthy, inordinate person having
perverted interest in sexual matters or having a tendency to morally corrupt and debase
persons likely to come in contact with the impugned art.129.
[s 292.2] Hicklin Test and Community Standard Test.—
One of the tests to be applied to find whether an article possesses the standard of
obscenity is the Hicklin Test.130. As per this, the test of obscenity is whether the
tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose
minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this
sort may fall. The other test is Community Standard Test, whereby the obscenity has to
be judged from the point of view of an average person, by applying contemporary
community standards. In Aveek Sarkar v State of WB,131. the Supreme Court was of the
view that Hicklin test is not the correct test to be applied to determine "what is
obscenity".
When the name of Mahatma Gandhi is alluded or used as a symbol, speaking or using
obscene words, the concept of "degree" comes in. To elaborate, the "contemporary
community standards test" becomes applicable with more vigour, in a greater degree
and in an accentuated manner.132.
[s 292.3] Khushboo Case.—
In Khushboo v Kanniammal,133. the appellant, a popular actress expressed her personal
opinion wherein she had noted the increasing incidence of pre-marital sex, especially in
the context of live-in relationships and called for the societal acceptance of the same.
However, appellant had also qualified her remarks by observing that girls should take
adequate precautions to prevent unwanted pregnancies and the transmission of
venereal diseases. The Supreme Court said it failed to see how the appellant's remarks
amount to 'obscenity' in the context of section 292 IPC, 1860. It was difficult to
appreciate the claim that the statements published as part of the survey were in the
nature of obscene communications.
[s 292.4] Meaning of the word obscene in sections 292, 293 and section
294(b).—
The word 'obscene' is not defined differently in these sections but the punishments
were prescribed differently in other sections depending upon the effect of 'obscenity'
that causes on the viewer or hearer as the case may be. That also would sufficiently
indicate that the said word is to be understood as understood for the purpose of
section 292.134.
[s 292.5] Certificate of Censor Board.—
Once the film is given a particular certification, no doubt the case of obscenity under
section 292 of the IPC, 1860, cannot be made out when the said film is shown to the
particular category for which the certificate is granted. Again, the pre-condition is that
there has to be a certification by the Board of Film Censors. In the absence of any such
certificate, the petitioners cannot claim immunity from prosecution under section 292
of the IPC.135. In GP Lamba v Tarun Mehta,136. explaining the role of the Censor Board
certificate,137. the Court said:
The law presumes the regular performance of official acts. This is not to suggest that the
grant of a certificate debars the court from judging the obscenity of a film..... or that the
certificate is conclusive.... such a certificate is the opinion of a high powered Board
especially entrusted with power to screen off the silver screen pictures which offensively
invade or deprave public morale through over-sex... The rebuttable presumption, which
arises in favour of the statutory certificate, can be negatived by positive evidence. No such
evidence was before the court.138.
In the matter of sex knowledge, the Court said:
In the present day society in India, a book, picture or a publication which deals with such
matter cannot per se be said to be obscene.139.
The Court further added that in order to satisfy the requirement of mens rea there must
be a distinct finding that the matter complained of was inserted by the order or owing
to the negligence of the proprietor.140.
[s 292.6] Public interest.—
An obscene advertisement was published in a daily. The advertiser said that the
publication was intended in good faith to promote sale of condoms. The advertisement
was withdrawn because of social objections. The advertiser also apologised. The
complaint filed by a social worker was no doubt maintainable but it was quashed
because the complainant's interest should give way to the larger public interest as to
whether prosecution would be proper in the circumstances of the case.141.
[s 292.7] For sale.—
Possession of obscene objects is punishable if the possession is for the purpose of
sale, hire, distribution, public exhibition or circulation. Persons who were found viewing
obscene films on television with the help of VCR could not be charged for the offence
punishable under section 292.142.
[s 292.8] Effect upon children.—
The accused could not be convicted of possessing an indecent photograph unless he
knew that he had the photograph in his possession. The "making" of an indecent
photograph included copying, downloading or storing it on a computer, provided that it
was done knowingly.143.
[s 292.9] Pornography, incitement for supply of material.—
Act of accused, privately viewing obscene film does not constitute on offence under
section 292 of IPC, 1860.144. Mere possession of an obscene cassette by itself does
not amount to an offence punishable under section 292(2) IPC. In the case on hand, the
accused was found managing a video shop wherein obscene cassette containing a
blue-film evidently kept for hire to the potential customers, was found. In such
circumstances, it cannot be said that the possession of the cassette was without the
requisite mens rea or that it and does not attract the ingredients of the offence
punishable under section 292 IPC.145. In another case, it was proved that the accused
showed pornographic film on the handicam to the prosecutrix. Though the charge of
rape failed, conviction under sections 292 and 506 was upheld.146.
Generally, evidence of expert is inadmissible whether an article or book has a tendency
to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to read, hear or see the matter in
question.147. The only exception is where the likely readers belong to a special class
such as young children,148. In Samaresh Base's case149. the Supreme Court of India
considered the evidence of two eminent Bengali novelists to determine whether the
book 'Prajapati', a Bengali novel, has a tendency to deprave and corrupt youth, who are
likely to read it and having regard to their evidence decided the case in favour of the
accused. It was however held that, though a Court of law may consider the views of
reputed authors or leading literatures, the ultimate duty to make a proper assessment
regarding obscenity or otherwise of a book rests only with the Court.150. The
prosecution need not prove something which the law does not burden it with. As
regards the second part of the guilty act (actus reus), i.e. the selling or keeping for sale
an object which is found to be obscene, here of course the ordinary mens rea is
required to be shown before the offence can be said to be complete. Even so, it was
held in this case that in criminal prosecution mens rea must necessarily be proved by
circumstantial evidence alone unless the accused confesses. Thus, it is not required
that prosecution must prove guilty intention to possess or possess for sale, by positive
evidence. The Court will presume that the owner of the shop is guilty if the book is sold
on his behalf and later found to be obscene unless he can establish that the sale was
without his knowledge or consent. Thus to escape liability he has to prove his lack of
knowledge.151. In India, it is also a defence to plead a certificate given by the Board of
Censors. Thus, a certificate granted by the Board of Censors under section 5A of the
Cinematograph Act 1952, certifying a film to be fit for public exhibition, circulation or
distribution would by virtue of section 79, IPC, 1860, make prosecution under section
292, IPC, unsustainable even if the film be obscene, lascivious or tending to deprave or
corrupt public morale. This is so as section 79, IPC, (justification on ground of bona fide
mistake of fact) is exculpatory when read with section 5A of the Cinematograph Act
and the certificate issued thereunder.152.
[s 292.10] Obscenity in the internet and other electronic mediums.—
section 67 of the Information Technology Act 2000 is the first statutory provisions
dealing with obscenity on the Internet in India. Sections 67, 67A and 67B of the
Information Technology Act 2000 deal with obscenity in electronic sphere.
It must be noted that the both under IPC, 1860, and the Information Technology Act,
2000, the test to determine obscenity is similar.153.
A special law shall prevail over the general and prior laws. Electronic forms of
transmission is covered by the IT Act, which is a special law. When the Act in various
provisions deals with obscenity in electronic form, it covers the offence under section
292 IPC, 1860. Once the special provisions having the overriding effect do cover a
criminal act and the offender, he gets out of the net of the IPC and in this case, section
292 IPC, 1860. Though charge has not been made out under section 67 of the IT Act,
yet the accused-appellant could not be proceeded under section 292 IPC.154.
