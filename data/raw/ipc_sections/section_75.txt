Imprisonment to terminate on payment of fine.
The imprisonment which is imposed in default of payment of a fine shall terminate
whenever that fine is either paid or levied by process of law.
COMMENTâ€”
The person sentenced to pay a fine must deposit the fine forthwith, but may be,
permitted to deposit it after some time in the discretion of the Court. Even in that event
he must deposit the amount before the period specifically fixed by the Court and if he
does not do so, he immediately incurs the liability of being sent to prison. It would be
the duty of the Court to arrest him and confine him into the prison. Only when such
confinement in the prison has commenced that the accused can have a legal right to
deposit the amount whereupon section 68 IPC, 1860 would come into operation and
his imprisonment would terminate.213. The time given by the High Court or the
Sessions Judges in appeal or revision for payment of fine merely means that the
realisation is deferred till the time granted. However, this cannot take away the rights of
the convicts as provided under section 68 and section 69 of the IPC, 1860. If the
convict offers to deposit the fine imposed on him beyond the period provided, the
Courts cannot refuse to accept the same. It must apply the provisions of section 68
and section 69 of the IPC, 1860.214. The period to deposit the amount of fine cannot be
extended by the High Court under section 482 Cr PC, 1973 and the petitioners can avail
the remedy of provisions of section 68 of IPC, 1860.215.
