Amendment of section 293, Central Act XLV of 1860.—In section 293 of the said Code—

COMMENT.—
This section provides for enhanced sentence where the obscene objects are sold, to
persons under the age of 20 years. By Act 36 of 1969 the punishment for the offence is
further enhanced. On going through section 293, it is clear that a separate penal
provision was made with regard to the sale, exhibition, of such obscene object to any
person under the age of 20 years where as section 292 (1) deals with sale, exhibition,
of such obscene object to any person. Therefore, in order to make the provision more
stringent and grave insofar as it relates to the sale, of obscene objects to younger
persons–aged less than 20 years, a separate penal provision, made applicable in
section 293, was introduced. It is in that context, the word 'obscene' occurring in
section 292(1) is made applicable to section 293 also.158. In a trial for the offences
under sections 292 and 293 of the IPC, 1860, a certificate granted under section 6 of
the Cinematograph Act by the Board of Censors does not provide an irrebuttable
defence to accused who have been granted such a certificate, but it is certainly a
relevant fact of some weight to be taken into consideration by the criminal Court in
deciding whether the offence charged is established. The Court must have regard to
the fact that the certificate represents the judgment of a body of persons particularly
selected under the statute for the specific purpose of adjudging the suitability of films
for public exhibition, and that judgment extends to a consideration of the principal
ingredients which go to constitute the offences under sections 292 and 293 of the IPC,
1860. At the same time, the Court must remind itself that the function of deciding
whether the ingredients are established is primarily and essentially its own function,
and it cannot abdicate that function in favour of another, no matter how august and
qualified be the statutory authority.159.
[s 293.1] CASE.—
The allegation is that the petitioner was a spectator of the blue-film and therefore an
abettor of the offences under sections 292, 293 and 294 IPC, 1860. This interposition
as a mere spectator to the exhibition of a blue-film without any further complicity, in
view of the above Supreme Court decision, cannot be taken to be amounting to
abetment of the main offence.160.
[s 293.2] Benefit of Probation.—
Exhibiting a blue-film in which man and woman were shown in the act of sexual
intercourse to young boys would definitely deprave and corrupt their morals. Their
minds are impressionable. On their impressionable minds, anything can be imprinted.
Things would have been different if that blue-film had been exhibited to mature minds.
Showing a man and a woman in the act of sexual intercourse tends to appeal to the
carnal side of the human nature. Even if he is the first offender, he cannot be given the
benefit of Probation of Offenders Act, 1958.161.
