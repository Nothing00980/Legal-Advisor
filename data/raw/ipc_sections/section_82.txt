COMMENT—
Principle.—This section does not constitute a separate offence but only imposes a
liability to enhanced punishment. What section 75 IPC, 1860 contemplates is that
where a person who has been, previously convicted of an offence punishable under
Chapter XII (which deals with offences relating to coin and Government stamps) or
Chapter XVII. (which relates to offences against property) with imprisonment of either
description for a term of three years or up-wards, is once again found guilty of a similar
offence, he shall be liable to enhanced punishment which may extend to imprisonment
for life or to imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten
years. The section is concerned with a previous conviction for a similar offence but it
does not postulate that in respect of the previous conviction, the punishment imposed
should have been one of not less than three years. All that it posits is that the previous
conviction should have been in respect of an offence punishable with a term of
imprisonment for a term of three years or upwards, but it does not lay down that the
offender should have been actually punished with such a term of imprisonment.257. It
does not apply to offences under other Acts.258.
1. 'Having been convicted'.—A plain reading of this provision goes to show that the
previous conviction ought to be for offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter
XVII and the sentence imposed is three years or more than that. If the sentence is less
than three years or the offence does not fall within any of the two Chapters then
section 75, IPC, 1860 would not be applicable. If any authority is required then
reference may be made to Re Kamya,259. wherein it has been held that the minimum
required for enhancement of punishment under section 75, IPC, 1860 is that the
previous conviction of the accused should have resulted in punishment of three years
or more.260. Section 75 is invoked for enhancement of the sentence and that can come
only at the time the sentence is to be imposed. The fact that the accused is an old
offender is not to be taken note of by the Court at the trial. Only at the conclusion of the
trial after entering the conviction, that question can be taken up for imposing the
sentence.261. Simply because the provisions of section 75 of the Indian Penal Code are
attracted in a particular case, is no ground for inflicting the extreme punishment
provided in that section. The provisions of this section are only permissive and not
obligatory. They do confer jurisdiction on the Courts to inflict enhanced punishment but
then that jurisdiction is to be exercised in a judicial manner after taking into
consideration the circumstances and the factors narrated above.262. Section 75, IPC,
1860 does not prescribe that a severe sentence should be imposed for repetition of any
crime by an offender. It does not prescribe a minimum sentence for any event. It does
not say that a convict of a petty theft committed without any violence should be given a
severe sentence if he had half a dozen previous convictions for like offences to his
credit.263.
[s 75.1] Clause (a).—
For the application of this section it is not necessary to show that the previous
sentence was for three years or upwards. What is required is that the previous
conviction was for an offence punishable under Chapter XII or XVII, for which sentence
of imprisonment could have been three years or upwards. The key word being
"punishable" the actual sentence awarded for the first offence is not of any
consequence so long the offence was punishable with imprisonment for three years or
upwards.264. It is also necessary to remember that the conviction for the earlier
offence must remain in operation on the date of conviction for second offence. Thus if
the previous conviction is set aside on appeal, the accused cannot be awarded
enhanced punishment under this section.265. Non-applicability of section 75, IPC has
nothing to do with the proof or guilt of the main offence. If section 75, IPC is found to
be inapplicable then it would not mean that the finding of guilt for certain offences
recorded by the Magistrate will also go away. The conviction for the offences would
stand and the accused would be liable to be sentenced for the main offence and the
sentence cannot be enhanced with the aid of section 75, IPC, 1860.266.
[s 75.2] Section 75 and Section 236 of Cr PC.—
Under section 236 (310 of old Code) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and under
section 75 of the Indian Penal Code, it is enough if the person concerned has been
earlier convicted. It is not necessary that the sentence should be in force. Bearing in
mind that section 75 of the IPC and section 236 (310 of old code) of the Code of
Criminal Procedure deal with persons with previous conviction and the previous
sentence need not necessarily be in force when the subsequent offence is committed–
it would be clear that the latter section is intended to be applicable only to cases to
which section 75 of the Indian Penal Code applies.267.
