fine only.
If the offence be punishable with fine only,209. [the imprisonment which the Court
imposes in default of payment of the fine shall be simple, and] the term for which the
Court directs the offender to be imprisoned, in default of payment of fine, shall not
exceed the following scale, that is to say, for any term not exceeding two months
when the amount of the fine shall not exceed fifty rupees, and for any term not

COMMENT—
This section refers solely to cases in which the offence is punishable with fine only and
has no application to an offence punishable either with imprisonment or with fine, but
not with both. Such offences are governed by section 65. For a consideration under this
section of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (61 of 1985), section
21 of which imposes a fine and imprisonment in default, see Daulat Raghunath Derale v
State of Maharashtra.210.
[s 67.1] Default sentence on non-payment of Maintenance.—
The sentence is imposed under section 125(3) of Cr PC, 1973 only as a mode of
enforcement of the direction to pay the amount of maintenance and not as a
punishment. The Supreme Court was considering the question whether the default
sentence, if undergone shall wipe off the liability.211. It is impermissible to impose a
sentence of rigorous imprisonment on a defaulter under section 125(3) Cr PC, 1973.
Only a sentence of simple imprisonment can be imposed under section 125(3) of Cr
PC, 1973.212.
209. Ins. by Act 8 of 1882, section 3.

was held that the purpose of sending him to jail is not to wipe out the liability which he has
refused to discharge. A sentence of jail is no substitute for the recovery of the amount of
monthly allowance which has fallen in arrears.
