Punishment for belonging to gang of thieves.
Whoever, at any time after the passing of this Act, shall belong to any wandering or
other gang of persons associated for the purpose of habitually committing theft or
robbery, and not being a gang of thugs or dacoits, shall be punished with rigorous
imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to
fine.
COMMENTâ€”
The principle enunciated in the last section is extended by this section to a gang of
thieves or robbers. It is not necessary to prove that each individual member of the gang
has habitually committed theft or has committed any particular theft in company with
the other members.254. Even so the word 'belonging' implies something more than
mere casual association. It conveys the notion of continuity and more or less continued
association of the accused with the gang extending over a considerable length of time
which must be proved so as to warrant an inference that the accused identified himself
with the gang the common purpose of which was the habitual commission of either
theft or robbery.255.

there being no charge at that time of receiving stolen property under section 410, the Supreme
Court did not in an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution convict under section 410.
