The Indian Tolls (Army and Air Force) Act, 1901
(2 Of 1901)
13.
 


/611
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-Section 134 of the Army Act (44 and 45 Vict., C. 58) exempts certain officers, soldiers and other persons and certain animals, baggage and carriages belonging or attached to the Army, from the payment of certain tolls, and the provision is applicable to India in common with the rest of Her Majesty's dominions. In the Indian Statute-book however, there are several enactments on the same subject; and these while they provide for exemption from the payment of tolls of the classes referred to in the Army Act, do so in favour of persons more or less different from those indicated in that Act. Moreover, there are some Acts of the Indian Legislatures which authorize the levy of tolls of the same classes as those described in the English Statute, but which either contain no exempting clauses at all or merely contain clauses empowering the executive to allow exemptions.
In these circumstances, it has been decided to legislate. In the case of those Indian enactments which contain lists of exempted persons and property, legislation is necessary in order to remove the conflict which at present exists between them and the Army Act. The latter would of course prevail if the conflict were brought to the notice of the Courts but, so long as the Indian enactments remain as they now are, it is probable that full effect may not always in practice be given to the Army Act. In the case, too of the remaining enactments of the Indian Legislatures above mentioned, it is not unlikely that the provisions of section 143, Army Act may be overlooked tolls being levied under the local law in cases in which their levy is in reality prohibited by Parliament.
The present Bill reproduces section 143, Army Act, except sub-section (2), which does not apply to India and amplifies its provisions so as to cover certain additional exemptions all inconsistent provisions to be found in the Indian Statute book being at the same time repealed. Section 22, Indian Councils Act, 1861 (24 and 25 Vict. C. 67), prevents the repeal of section 143, Army Act by the Governor General's Legislative Council, but it is believed that there is nothing td'-pr-event that Council from re-enacting the section, and in doing so extendinflhe list of persons and property to be exempted from payment of tolls. The list now given in the Bills is a provisional one only. It requires careful consideration, and attention is, therefore, specially invited to its details ................"
