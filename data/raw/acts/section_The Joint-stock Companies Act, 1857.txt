LXXXIV. Power of Court to stay proceedings.-
The Court may, at any time after an order has been made for winding-up a Company, upon the application of any creditor or contributory of the Company, and upon proof to the satisfaction of the Court that all proceedings in relation to such winding-up ought to be stayed, make an order staying the same, either altogether or for a limited time, on such terms and subject to such conditions as it deems fit.
