COMMENT.—
The mixing of noxious ingredients in food or drink or otherwise rendering it
unwholesome by adulteration is punishable under this section. Mere adulteration with
harmless ingredients for the purpose of getting more profit is not punishable under it,
e.g., mixing water with milk16. or ghee (clarified butter) with vegetable oil.17.
'Adulteration' means mixing with any other substance whether wholly different or of the
same kind but of inferior quality.
The expression 'noxious as food' means unwholesome as food or injurious to health
and not repugnant to one's feelings.18. It is essential to show that an article of food or
drink has been adulterated and that it was intended to sell such article or that it was
known that it would be likely to be sold as food or drink.19.
[s 272.1] Adulteration of liquor.—
In order to establish that the offence under section 272, IPC, 1860 has been committed,
the prosecution has to prove that the article involved was food or drink meant to be
consumed by live persons, that the accused adulterated it, that such adulteration
rendered it noxious as food or drink and that the accused at the time of such
adulteration intended to sell such article as food or drink or knew it to be likely that
such article would be sold as food or drink. Now noxious rendering is making it
poisonous or harmful or both. As is plain the offence is complete on introduction of the
adulterant in the food or drink, provided it is meant for the purposes of sale, actual or
likely.20.
[s 272.2] Local Amendments.—
In West Bengal, sections 272, 273, 274, 275 and 276 of the Penal Code have been
amended by section 3 of West Bengal Act XLII of 1973 so as to provide life
imprisonment with or without fine for the aforesaid offences. By section 5 of West
Bengal Act XXXIV of 1974, all these offences have been made cognizable, non-bailable
and triable by Court of Sessions. The State of Uttar Pradesh too has similarly made all
these offences punishable with life imprisonment and fine with similar discretion of
Court to award lesser imprisonment by virtue of Uttar Pradesh Act 47 of 1975.
There is no bar under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 and the said Rules
made thereunder that the concerned authorities under Prevention of Food Adulteration
Act have no jurisdiction and/or authority to prosecute the guilty person for the offences
under the IPC based on the same averments along with the provisions of the special
statutes. All such authorities have jurisdiction to launch a prosecution by invoking
various provisions of the IPC, along with the special statutes.21.
[s 272.3] Gutka and Pan Masala.—
In order to find out whether the food is unsafe, due to an adulterant, the sample is to be
sent to an analyst. Violation of the order of the Food Safety Commissioner is not an
offence, under section 272 IPC, 1860.22.
