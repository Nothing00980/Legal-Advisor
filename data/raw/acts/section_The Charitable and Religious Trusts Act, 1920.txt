Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The Religious Endowments Act, 1863 (
20 of 1863
), was the result of the decision of the Government to divest its officers of all direct superintendence and control of religious and charitable endowments in India, transferring their functions to manager or managing committees and merely making provision for intervention by the Civil Courts on application made by any person interested in a particular institution. This Policy, however, did not long remain unchallenged, and since 1866 there have been constant complaints, especially in the Madras Presidency, as to the inefficacy of the Act to prevent the squandering or misappropriation of the funds of such endowments, and suggestions for its amendments have from time to time been made to the Government of India. Mr. Ananda Charlu in 1897, Mr. Srinivasa Rao in 1903 and Dr. (now Sir) Rash Behari Ghosh in 1908, for example, promoted amending Bills, but none of them became law. More recently in 1911, a private Bill was introduced in Bombay Legislative Council by the Hon'ble Sir Ibrahim Rahimtoola, to provide for the registration of all, charitable trusts, exceeding a certain value and for the annual audit of the accounts of such trusts, by auditors approved by Government. Endowments of a purely religious nature were not included but the contents of the Bill made it clear that the ultimate object was to press for legislation for religious as well as secular trusts. About the same time a private Bill was promoted by two non-official members of the Madras Legislative Council to provided for the regular publication of the accounts of all religious endowments above a certain value and for their audit by an officer to be appointed by the District Judge. These proposals led the Government of India to reconsider the policy in force since 1863. In March 1914, the whole subject was discussed at a mixed conference of official and non-official gentlemen representing the Hindu, Muhammadan, Sikh and Buddhist communities. The present Bill, which is the outcome of the deliberations of that conference, has as its objects he simplification and cheapening of the legal processes by which persons interested can obtain information regarding the working of both religious and charitable trusts, and the exercise of a more efficient control over the action of trustees. The Bill provides that any person interested in a trust may apply by petition to the District Judge for an order directing the trustee to furnish him with information as to the nature and objects of the trust and of the value, condition, management and application of the subject-matter of the trust, and of the income belonging thereto, or as to any of these matters, and also directing that the accounts of the trust shall be examined and audited. Failure to comply with such an order of the Court would be deemed a breach of trust. In order, however, that such applications should not lead to protracted and contentious litigation, the Court is debarred from trying any question of title between the petitioner and any person claiming title to the trust, or any question as to the existence or extent of any trust. Under the Bill, it will be left to those interested to move in the matter; the initiative will not rest with Government, nor will anything be done where no one is sufficiently interested to take action. When the Court is moved the proceedings will be simple and expeditious; they will be held in the presence of all parties, and the order passed will be a judicial order of the Court. Further, in order to meet the objection that recourse to section 14 of the Act of 1863 or section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, involves expensive litigation the Court is authorised, on the application of the plaintiff and after the defendant is heard, to direct the defendant either to furnish security for the incurred or likely to be incurred in bringing and maintaining the suit or to deposit in Court an amount sufficient to meet such
It will be observed that the draft Bill only embodies general principles. It is intended that such details as the institution of some public record of the facts regarding these trusts, the publication of audited accounts, and the relaxation of some of the conditions governing committees constituted under the Act of 1863, e.g., the tenure of the membership of such committee should be left to Provincial Legislatures.
