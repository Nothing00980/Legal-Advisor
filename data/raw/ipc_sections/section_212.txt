Whoever fraudulently or dishonestly, or with intent to injure or annoy any person,

with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.â€”
This section relates to false and fraudulent claims in a Court of Justice. It is much
wider than the last section as it applies to a person who is acting fraudulently or
dishonestly. Not only must the claim be false to the knowledge of the person making it,
but the object of it must be to defraud, to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain, to
injure or to annoy. The section punishes the making of a false claim. The offence will
be complete as soon as a suit is filed. If a person applies for the execution of a decree
which has already been executed his act will be an offence under the next section.215.
Where the Court took cognizance of a complaint against dishonestly making a false
claim in a Court without complaint of the concerned civil judge, the cognizance was
held to be not justified by reason of section 195(b)(ii), Cr PC, 1973 that covers such
offences.216. The Court had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of offence under
sections 193/ 209/34 IPC, 1860 without having received any complaint under section
195 from the concerned civil Court.217.
