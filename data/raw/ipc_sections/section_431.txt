Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property.
Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any
property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable
security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being
converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to
fine.
COMMENT—
Simple cheating is punishable under section 417. But where there is delivery or
destruction of any property or alteration or destruction of any valuable security
resulting from the act of the person deceiving this section comes into operation. For an
offence under this section it must be proved that the complainant parted with his
property acting on a representation which was false to the knowledge of the accused
and that the accused had a dishonest intention from the outset.549. In Sonbhandra
Coke Products v State of UP,550. it was held that offence of cheating can be made out
only if it has been shown that damage or harm has been caused to the person so
deceived.
The Supreme Court has held that the word 'property' in this section does not
necessarily mean that the thing, of which a delivery is dishonestly desired by the
person who cheats, must have a money value or a market value, in the hand of the
person cheated. The communicated order of assessment received by an assessee is
"property".551.
An admission card to sit for an Examination of a University is property within the
meaning of this section; though the admission card as such has no pecuniary value it
has immense value to the candidate for the examination.552.A driving licence or its
duplicate553. had been held to be property within the meaning of this section. Where a
bank was defrauded of a large amount and the signatures of the accused bank
manager on drafts used for the purpose were proved beyond doubt to be his signature,
his conviction under the section was held to be proper.554. Where a builder was
defrauded by a conspiring team of financiers by giving him counterfeit currency,
conviction under this section was fully warranted.555. In the ordinary course of things,
relationship of banker and customer is that of debtor and creditor and not that of
trustee and beneficiary. Payment of money against cheques already issued by the
customer at a time when the bank had received notice to close the account did not in
itself amount to cheating the customer in conspiracy with the payee.556.
[s 420.1] Intention to deceive at the time of inducement.—
The primary requirement to make out an offence of cheating under section 415
punishable under section 420 IPC, 1860 is dishonest/fraudulent intention at the time of
inducement is made.557. The intention to deceive should be in existence at the time
when the inducement was made. Mere failure to keep up a promise subsequently
cannot be presumed as leading to cheating.558.
The intention to deceive was held to be not there either at the initial stage or any
subsequent stage in the mere fact of transferring a portion of the property over which
the transferors had no complete ownership. The sale could be binding only to the
extent of the transferor's right.559. Where bogus receipts were issued for part payment
of the price of the property over which the recipient had no ownership and therefore, no
right to sell, he was held to be guilty of the offence under the section.560.
[s 420.2] Dishonour of cheque.—
A cheque was returned unpaid by the bank under the remark "payment stopped by
drawer". The complainant alleged that the cheque was dishonoured because the
drawer of the cheque had no sufficient balance or arrangement. The Court refused to
quash the complaint. Issuing a cheque without arrangement of sufficient funds may
amount to cheating.561. Where goods were delivered in a normal sales transaction and
the buyer had also become the owner of the goods because the transfer of ownership
was not linked with payment, it was held that the fact that a cheque for the price, which
was issued in due course, bounced, did not constitute the offence of cheating because
there was no evidence of intention to cheat at the outset of the transaction.562.
Dishonest intention cannot be inferred from the bouncing of a cheque issued for an
existing debt. The conviction of the accused for return of such cheque was not
proper.563.
A cheque was handed over in a share transaction by the accused. The cheque was
signed by his wife. The person who passed the cheque was held guilty of cheating
because of the dishonour but not his wife because she was not seen anywhere near
the transaction.564.
[s 420.3] Section 138, NI Act and section 420 IPC, 1860.—
In the prosecution under section 138 Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the mens rea,
i.e., fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of issuance of Cheque is not required
to be proved. But in a prosecution under section 420 IPC, 1860 the issue of mens rea
may be relevant. There may be some overlapping of facts in the cases under section
420 IPC, 1860 and section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, but ingredients of
offences are entirely different. Thus, the subsequent case is not barred.565.
[s 420.4] Conversion of Cheques.—
Cheques issued by a company in the name of a supplier were converted by an
employee of the company by opening an account in the name of the supplier. The
opening of the account was facilitated by an employee of the bank. Both of them were
held to be joint offenders. The order of convicting both of them was held to be not
improper.566.
[s 420.5] Sections 417 and 420.—
In every case when property is delivered by a person cheated, there must always be a
stage when the person makes up his mind to give the property on accepting the false
representation made to him. It cannot be said that in such cases the person
committing the offence can only be tried for the simple offence of cheating under
section 417 and cannot be tried under this section because the person cheated parts
with his property subsequent to making up his mind to do so.567.
[s 420.6] Goods received under hire-purchase.—
Breach of the conditions of a hire purchase agreement under which goods or property
has been received does not amount to an offence under this section.568.
Where the complainant stated that the accused had taken the vehicle on hire-purchase
but failed and neglected to pay certain instalments and the Court found that there was
no dishonest intention on the part of the hirer at the time of the transaction, the
complaint was quashed, the Court observed that it was open to the complainant to
proceed against the hirer before a civil Court for appropriate relief.569.
[s 420.7] Arbitration clause.—
The presence of an arbitration clause in an agreement cannot prevent criminal
prosecution of a person if the ingredients of the offence are made out to the prima
facie extent.570.
[s 420.8] Financial crime.—
The accused an investment advisor charged with dishonestly concealing material facts
relating to bonds. The question was whether he had committed the alleged act of
dishonesty contrary to the Financial Services Act, 1986 section 47(1). Such
determination would have to include considering his intentions as to his future
conduct. It was held that the phrase "material facts" within section 47(1) was to be
widely construed so as to include his present intention as to future conduct. Dishonest
concealment was also included within "material facts". It was required under section
4(A) of the 1964 Act to consider his intentions and it was appropriate for the jury to
consider such intentions, not in relation to dishonesty, but in relation to the victims of
the alleged acts in connection with the particulars of the offence.571.
[s 420.9] Finance company's inability to pay back deposits.—
A finance company was not able to pay back deposit owing to its poor financial
condition as found by the Company Law Board and Reserve Bank. The Court found no
evidence of any intention to commit criminal breach of trust or any dishonest
inducement. The complaint was held liable to be quashed.572.
Issuing cheques with knowledge that they would be dishonoured amounts to an
offence under this section.573. Offence under section 420 was alleged against the
accused for issuance of cheque, who died and his business was inherited by his son.
Police filed final report stating that the son is liable. The Court held that as it is well-
settled law that a criminal's culpable offence shall not be inherited by his heirs. Once
the accused died, the charge against the accused has been dismissed as abates.574.
[s 420.10] Legal opinion given by Advocate.—
Allegation is that advocate submitted false legal opinion to the bank in respect of the
housing loans in the capacity of a panel advocate and did not point out actual
ownership of the properties in question. The liability against an opining advocate arises
only when the lawyer has an active participant in a plan to defraud the bank. Merely
because his opinion may not be acceptable, he cannot be made liable for criminal
prosecution, particularly, in the absence of tangible evidence that he associated with
other conspirators. There is no prima facie case for proceeding in respect of the
charges alleged against him. Proceedings quashed.575.
[s 420.11] Fraudulent inducement for deposits, each deposit a separate
offence.—
Where a fraudulent finance company collects deposits, there is a separate offence
towards each depositor. The fact that the maximum punishment of five years is
prescribed for a single offence of a cheating could not be pressed into service by the
accused for seeking relief.576.
[s 420.12] Punishment.—
The accused obtained payments from the Government by sending bills with bogus
railway receipt numbers. This was a false representation which amounted to cheating.
A long period of 30 years had passed since then. The sentence of one year
imprisonment was reduced to the period already undergone but the fine of Rs. 15,000
was maintained.577. In a conspiracy to benefit from a forged will, the Court imposed
maximum possible punishment.578.
[s 420.13] Pendency of civil suit.—
A civil suit for specific performance was already pending against the party who caused
the deception. The Court said that criminal proceeding was not to be quashed on that
basis alone.579.
[s 420.14] Proceedings quashed because the dispute is purely civil in nature.—
It may be true that where the Court finds that the dispute between the parties was
purely of civil nature, it may not allow criminal proceedings to go on. But no such law
can be laid down because a case may be such that both a civil action and criminal
complaint may be maintainable, the cause of action for both being the same.580. Mere
breach of contract does not necessarily involve cheating.581. Where the dispute is
essentially about the profit of the hotel business and its ownership, it is purely civil in
nature and hence, the proceedings are quashed.582. Where, complaint is about the non-
payment after placing orders for fabrication work on complainant, the complaint would
only reveal that the allegations as contained in the complaint are of civil nature and do
not prima facie disclose commission of alleged criminal offence under section 420 IPC,
1860. Proceedings quashed.583. Allegation was that appellant had executed a sale
deed in his favour in respect of a plot of land which had already been the subject
matter of a previous transfer, Court held that he can at best question such transfer and
claim damages in respect thereof from the vendor of the appellant by way of
appropriate damages, but an action in the Criminal Court would not lie in the absence
of any intention to cheat and/or defraud.584. An agreement for sale of land and the
earnest money paid to the owner as part consideration and possession of the land
having been transferred to the purchasers/complainants and the subsequent
unwillingness of the owner to complete the same, gave rise to a liability of a civil nature
and the criminal complaint was, therefore, not competent.585.
[s 420.15] Using forged marks sheet.—
The petitioner knew that they were submitting a forged marks-sheet for the purpose of
securing a seat in the medical college. Their conviction under sections 420 and 471
(using as genuine a forged document) was held to be proper. Failure in securing the
purpose would not result in acquittal.586.
[s 420.16] Checking in under false pretences.—
The allegation against the accused was that he made a representation to the railway
retiring room attendant that he was an Assistant Commercial Manager in railways and
got a room allotted to him on that basis. Thus, a prima facie case of cheating was
made out. The complaint was not to be quashed.587.
[s 420.17] Juristic persons.—
The punishment of imprisonment provided under the section cannot be imposed on a
juristic person, a construction company in this case.588.
In order to hold persons liable vicariously for any offence involved in the affairs of the
company, it is not enough to show that they were running the affairs of the company.
All the ingredients of the offence must be proved against them. The company has also
to be made a party to the proceeding. In this case, there were only individual
accusations against the persons concerned.589.
[s 420.18] Previous sanction.—
The offence of cheating under section 420 or for that matter offences relatable to
section 467, section 468, section 471 and section 120B can by no stretch of
imagination by their very nature be regarded as having been committed by any public
servant while acting or purporting to act in discharge of official duty. Hence, the
sanction of the competent authority under section 197 Cr PC, 1973 is not required.590.
[s 420.19] Compounding.—
Where the allegation was that accused with the assistance of known officials of AICTE
had produced forged and fraudulent document to obtain recognition of the mentioned
institution from AICTE and thereby cheated AICTE, the application for compounding of
offence could not have been considered by the learned Magistrate without affording an
opportunity of hearing to the AICTE. It is not the CBI which has been cheated by the
action of the respondent No. 1 but in fact the AICTE.591.
[s 420.20] Section 420 with non-compoundable offences.—
Simply because an offence is not compoundable under section 320 Cr PC, 1973 is by
itself no reason for the High Court to refuse exercise of its power under section 482 Cr
PC, 1973. That power can be exercised in cases where there is no chance of recording
a conviction against the accused and the entire exercise of a trial is destined to be an
exercise in futility.592.
