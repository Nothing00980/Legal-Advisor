evidence of either enticement or rape, the mere presence of semen stains on the frock of the

because of a variety of reasons and would not necessarily connect him with the offence of rape.

SC 2472 [LNIND 1995 SC 776] : 1995 Cr LJ 4173 , the sole testimony of the prosecutrix
corroborated by medical evidence found reliable, conviction of the accused under section 375
upheld; Dharma v Nirmal Singh Bittu, AIR 1996 SC 1136 [LNIND 1996 SC 272] : 1996 Cr LJ 1631 ,
where the accused was found guilty of attempt to rape and committing murder of his victim, the
Supreme Court set aside the acquittal of the accused and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

LJ 4700 , evidence of the victim appearing to be probable. The court exposed the
impermissibility of insistence by the accused on corroboration of the testimony. No accused
can cling to a fossil formula and insist on corroboration even if the case taken as a whole
strikes to the judicial mind as probable. Judicial response to human rights cannot be allowed to
be blunted by legal jugglery. Shrawan v State of Maharashtra, (2006) 13 SCC 191 , the allegation
of rape of the woman and assault on her husband when the latter went to the house of the
accused to protest, police antipathy, alleged facts seemed to be true, conviction and sentence
upheld.

corroboration is not required as a rule. The fact of a litigation between the complainant and
accused families was not material because a father would not involve his daughter into such a
bad role. Laxman Dass v State of Rajasthan, 2001 Cr LJ 4501 , corroboration not considered
necessary, injuries on person though not on private part, conviction. Gurmit Singh case was
followed in State of Karnataka v Manjanna, AIR 2000 SC 2231 [LNIND 2000 SC 812] : 2000 Cr LJ
3471 here also acquittal was set aside, the court saying that the conclusion of the court below
regarding reaction of the victim and her mother and delay in lodging the FIR was contrary to
evidence. Visweswaran v State of TN, 2003 Cr LJ 2548 (SC), rape by accused constable in hotel
room, no identification by the victim, but the room was booked by him, he was arrested at the
hotel premises and he was not able to explain his whereabouts at about the time of offence.
The court said that these circumstances sufficiently made him out.

: 2007 Cr LJ 2733 , testimony of the prosecutrix found to be not believable, no conviction on that
basis. State of Punjab v Ramdev Singh, AIR 2004 SC 1290 [LNIND 2003 SC 1106] ; State of
Chhattisgarh v Derha, (2004) 9 SCC 699 [LNIND 2004 SC 535] ; State of HP v Shree Kant Shekari,
AIR 2004 SC 4404 [LNIND 2004 SC 921] . Medical evidence that the victim showed signs of
previous sexual intercourse, the court said it would not have any adverse effect on her
testimony. It could not be a ground for acquitting the rapist. Wahid Khan v State of MP, (2010) 1
SCC Cr 1208 : (2010) 2 SCC 9 [LNIND 2009 SC 2041] : AIR 2010 SC 1 [LNIND 2009 SC 2041] ,
evidence of prosecutrix stands on equal footing with that of an injured witness and if it inspires
confidence, corroboration is not necessary. The court noted the adverse things like social
repercussions, backward society, dangers of being ostracized, difficulties of rehabilitation and
survival, psychology not to admit adverse unless it was a fact. A 12-year-old girl was the victim
in this case, being taken away by the accused in auto-rickshaw.
1231. State of HP v Sanjay Kumar, 2016 (4) Crimes 424 (SC) : 2016 (12) Scale 831 .

Supreme Court expressed the opinion that sole testimony is not to be relied upon unless it is
safe, reliable and worthy of acceptance. State of Punjab v Chatinder Pal Singh, (2008) 17 SCC 90
[LNINDORD 2008 SC 308] : AIR 2009 SC 974 [LNINDORD 2008 SC 308] , prosecution witnesses
going back upon their statements, two inconsistent dying declaration, when two courts on
analysis of evidence found the accused not guilty, no scope for interference.
1237. Shatrughan v State of MP, 1993 Cr LJ 120 (MP). Thomas v State of Kerala, 1999 Cr LJ 1297
(Ker), accused committed forced sex from behind, medical opinion that such act was possible
by use of force. Offence proved and conviction upheld. State of Rajasthan v Om Prakash, AIR
2002 SC 2235 [LNIND 2002 SC 370] (Supp), charge proved, non-examination of witnesses other
than family members was immaterial. Fota v State of Rajasthan, 1999 Cr LJ 1677 (Raj), charge
of rape found to be false, one of the reasons for the finding being that the father of the girl had
compromised with the alleged rapist, this could not be probable. State of Punjab v Gurdeep
Singh, 1999 Cr LJ 4597 : (2000) 8 SCC 547 [LNIND 2000 SC 1292] , the only evidence was that
the accused was seen by a relative of the girl chasing her in a drunken state, but he did nothing,
not enough to connect that man with rape and murder. Suresh N Bhusane v State of Maharashtra,
1998 Cr LJ 4559 : AIR 1998 SC 3131 [LNIND 1998 SC 733] , voluntary conduct rather than
forcible lifting, charge of rape not proved. Prahlad Singh v State of MP, 1997 Cr LJ 4078 : AIR
1997 SC 3442 [LNIND 1997 SC 1080] , fact of rape established, but the accused could not be
identified by the victim girl. Acquittal. Prakash Sakharam Mandale v State of Maharashtra, 1997
Cr LJ 4199 (Bom), the victim's age could not be established beyond doubt. She remained silent
about her age. This fact spoke of her connivance. Acquittal.
1238. State of Maharashtra v Madhukar N Mardikar, (1991) 1 SCC 57 [LNIND 1990 SC 610] : AIR
1991 SC 207 [LNIND 1990 SC 610] . For a review of case—law on the need for corroboration see
State of Maharashtra v Kalgya Kale, 1989 Cr LJ 1389 (Bom). See also Daler Singh v State of
Haryana, (1995) 1 Cr LJ 614 (P&H), no implicit reliance can be placed upon the testimony of a
prosecutrix who is a woman of easy virtue and seems to be consenting. There were other
infirmities also in the evidence tendered, hence acquittal.
1239. Banti v State of MP, 1992 Cr LJ 715 (MP). Mohan v State of MP, 2001 Cr LJ 3046 (MP), it is
no defence that the girl was used for sex. The spontaneity in disclosure of the incident by the
prosecurtix has a greater value as res gestae. It is substantive evidence.
1240. State of UP v Om, 1999 Cr LJ 5030 : 1998 SCC (Cr) 1343. Milind Ambadas Mhaske v State,
1998 Cr LJ 357 (Bom), bad character of the prosecutrix does not enable the accused to escape
from his culpability. Grown-up married woman having two children, consent could not be
inferred from the absence of injuries on private part. Sanju Gupta v State of Orissa, 1998 Cr LJ
1684 (Ori), a woman may be of immoral character, persons forcing her to sex against her will
would be guilty of rape.
