COMMENTâ€”
This section provides for cases not coming within the purview of sections 421 and 422.
It contemplates such a concealment or removal of property from the place in which it is
deposited, as can be considered fraudulent. Where one of the several partners removed
the partnership books at night, and when questioned denied having done so;598. where
a judgment-debtor, whose standing crops were attached, harvested them while the
attachment was in force;599. where the accused who was bound under the conditions
of his tenure to share the produce of his land with the landholder in a certain
proportion, dishonestly concealed and removed the produce, thus preventing the
landholder from taking his due share,600. it was held that this offence was committed.
But a removal of crops to avoid an illegal restraint,601. or removal of property, which
was attached after the date fixed for the return of the warrant of attachment, from the
possession of the custodian602. was held not to amount to an offence under this
section. Certain crops were attached in execution of a decree and placed in the
custody of a bailiff. The crops did not belong to the judgment-debtors, and the owners
cut and removed a portion of them in spite of the resistance of the bailiff. It was held
that no offence was committed.603. In order to bring the case within section 424, IPC,
1860 it is necessary to show that there has been dishonest or fraudulent concealment
or removal of any property or dishonest or fraudulent assistance in the matter of
concealment or removal of the property. The other part of section 424 is not applicable
and therefore, it is not adverted to. There is no case in the complaint that any furniture
or equipment have been concealed or removed. The facts averred do not indicate any
such removal or concealment. What is stated is that they are still there, but that the
complainant is being obstructed from exercising the rights of joint possession over
them. The question of assisting in the dishonest or fraudulent removal arises only if
there is concealment. Therefore, section 424, IPC, 1860 is not applicable.604.
