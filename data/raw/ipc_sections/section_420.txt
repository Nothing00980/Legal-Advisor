Criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or
agent.
Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over
property in his capacity of a public servant1 or in the way of his business as a banker,2
merchant,3 factor,4 broker,5 attorney6 or agent,7 commits criminal breach of trust in
respect of that property, shall be punished with 367.[imprisonment for life], or with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT—
This section classes together public servants, bankers, merchants, factors, brokers,
attorneys and agents. As a rule the duties of such persons are of a highly confidential
character, involving great powers of control over the property entrusted to them; and a
breach of trust by such persons may often induce serious public and private calamity.
[s 409.1] Ingredients.—
In order to sustain conviction under section 409, IPC, 1860, two ingredients are to be
proved; namely, (i) the accused, a public servant or a banker or agent was entrusted
with the property of which he is duty bound to account for; and (ii) the accused has
committed criminal breach of trust. What amounts to criminal breach of trust is
provided under section 405, IPC, 1860. The basic requirement to bring home the
accusations under section 405 are the requirements to prove conjointly (i) entrustment
and (ii) whether the accused was actuated by dishonest intention or not,
misappropriated it or converted it to his own use to the detriment of the persons who
entrusted it.368.
Merely because the accused allegedly kept the amount in defiance of the official
instruction, it cannot be an incriminating circumstance to arrive at a conclusion that he
has committed the breach of trust. It is a settled position of law that suspicion
howsoever grave cannot take the place of proof.369.
The section cannot be construed as implying that any head of an office that is
negligent in seeing that the rules about remitting money to the treasury are observed is
ipso facto guilty of criminal breach of trust; but something more than that is required to
bring home the dishonest intention. There should be some indication which justifies a
finding that the accused definitely had the intention of wrongfully keeping Government
out of the moneys.370. Subjecting to a civil liability would thus attract one of the
ingredients of criminal breach of trust. There cannot be, however, any doubt
whatsoever that a mere error of judgment would not attract the penal provision
contained in section 409 of the IPC, 1860.371. the fact that the accused puts back the
money,372. or promises to do so,373. does not wipe out the offence or absolve him from
liability. Where a post-master misappropriated the money entrusted to him but paid
back the whole amount before being challenged, his acquittal on this ground was held
to be wrong.374. But the Courts do take that fact into account as a mitigating factor
and would consider light punishment as sufficient to meet the ends of justice.375.
Where certain articles disappeared from an open godown which was being watched by
a Chowkidar (watchman), it was held that the over-all incharge overseer could not be
held liable under the section unless there was the proof that the articles disappeared
because of his doings or non-doings.376.
The offence under the section requires criminal intent or mens rea. Where in the matter
of post office deposit accounts, all that was proved showed that there was negligence
in maintaining them, the Court said that it could be a fit case for departmental
proceedings but not proceedings under section 409 because the intention to
misappropriate the proceeds of the accounts was not in evidence.377.
[s 409.2] Property of Government company.—
The property of a Government company was purchased by a firm of which the accused
was a partner. He was the CM of the company. The CM or the Minister was not shown
to have dominion over the property of the company. The relationship between the CM
and the company was not shown to be of trustee and fiduciary. It was held that the
ingredients of the section were not satisfied.378. The complaint does not contain the
averment that Rs.5 lakhs was entrusted to the appellant, either in his personal capacity
or as the Chairman of Maharashtra State Electricity Board and that he misappropriated
it for his own use. The said amount was deposited by the complainant company with
MSEB and there is nothing in the complaint which may even remotely suggest that the
complainant had entrusted any property to appellant or that the appellant had
dominion over the said money of the complainant, which was converted by him to his
own use, so as to satisfy the ingredients of section 405 IPC, 1860. Proceedings
quashed.379.
[s 409.3] Prosecution against company.—
Since, the majority of the Constitution Bench ruled in Standard Chartered Bank v
Directorate of Enforcement.380. That the company can be prosecuted even in a case
where the Court can impose substantive sentence as also fine, and in such case only
fine can be imposed on the corporate body.381.
[s 409.4] Ownership right in films.—
In an agreement for film production the terms stated that the rights in the negative of
the film and the right of distribution for exhibition were to be vested in the complainant.
The accused, the other party, departed from the terms and exhibited the film publicly
without consent of the complainant. It was held that the accused was guilty of the
offence of breach of trust.382.
[s 409.5] Temporary misappropriation.—
The allegation is that while he was working as a Lower Division Clerk in the Office of
the Deputy Superintendent of Police, the accused had temporarily misappropriated an
amount of Rs. 1,839. Admittedly, the sum had been deposited in the post office before
the due date and that no loss had been caused to the Department, even if it is assumed
that a false entry had been made in the record. Offence alleged under IPC, 1860 against
the appellant are trivial in nature and have caused no harm and in fact no offences in
the eye of law. The benefit of section 95 IPC, 1860 is available to the appellant.383.
1. 'In his capacity of a public servant'.—Persons like public servants, bankers, etc., who
are made liable under the section occupy a position of highly confidential nature
involving great power of control over property entrusted to them. Breach of trust by
such persons may result in serious public or private calamity. High morality is expected
from such persons. They are supposed to discharge their duties honestly.384. Where a
police dog handler had taken a sum of money by way of travelling and daily allowance
(TA, DA), but went on to his native place on unauthorized absence and returned the
money on coming back, it was held that he did not use the money for the official
purpose and though the diversion was temporary, it constituted an offence under the
section. The trial Court convicted him. It was held that there was no scope for
interference in the judgment of the trial Court.385.
2. 'Banker'.—A banker is one who receives money to be drawn out again as the owner
has occasion for it, the customer being lender, and the banker borrower, with the
superadded obligation of honouring the customer's cheques up to the amount of the
money received and still in the banker's hands.386. The word 'banker' includes a cashier
or shroff.387. In ANZ Grindlays Bank plc v Shipping and Clearing (Agents) Pvt Ltd,388. it
was held that relation between the bank and its depositors is that of debtor and
creditor but that the relation of trust can be created under special circumstances.
Where the principal debtor did not repay the bank loan, the bank as creditor can adjust
it at the maturity of the fixed deposit receipts deposited by the guarantor with the bank
as security, though the debt became barred by limitation at the time of maturity of the
said fixed deposit receipts. Such adjustment would not amount to offences punishable
under sections 109, 114 and 409 IPC, 1860.389. Bank officials who allowed advance
credits on banker's cheques to a customer in violation of Departmental instructions
acted in violation of direction of law. The officials had dominion over the money
belonging to the bank and they dishonestly used that money for conferring a benefit on
the customer. They were held guilty of the offence under the section.390.
[s 409.6] Securities Scam.—
The National Housing Bank cannot advance loans to anybody except housing finance
institutions, scheduled banks and statutory slum clearance bodies. The advancement
of any loan to any individual is an offence under National Housing Bank Act, 1987.
Allegation of advancement of loan to Harshad Mehta by NHB under the disguise of a
call money transaction was held illegal. If as result of that illegal transaction a private
person who was not expected to reap the fruit of 'call money' was allowed to retain the
same for a period to make an unlawful gain therefrom, offence of criminal breach of
trust must be held to be have been committed.391.
3. 'Merchant'.—A merchant is one who traffics to remote countries; also any one
dealing in the purchase and sale of goods.392. A failure on the part of persons
responsible to refund the share application money when it becomes refundable
because of the stock exchange refusal to approve the prospectus, has been taken to be
a misappropriation by a merchant.393.
4. 'Factor'.—Is a substitute in mercantile affairs; an agent employed to sell goods or
merchandise consigned or delivered to him by or for his principal, for a compensation
commonly called factorage or commission.394. Complainant took loan from company
against shares of complainant. Shares were not returned to him after repayment of
loan. Court below has found that the charge under section 409 was tenable since,
though the accused were not bankers or the public servants, they would fit in the
category of factor. The "factor" has been defined in Law Lexicon as "A factor is a
mercantile agent who, in the customary course of his business as such agent, is
entrusted with the possession or control of goods, wares, or merchandise for sale on
commission". An agent employed to sell goods or merchandise consigned or delivered
to him, by or for his principal, for compensation commonly called "factorage" or
"commission". The Bombay High Court held that it cannot be held that accused
directors of company were agent, employed by complainant, to sell goods or
merchandise, entrusted to them for compensation called a "factorage" or "commission"
and the accused were not covered by definition of 'factor' as envisaged under section
409 IPC, 1860.395.
5. 'Broker'.—Is an agent employed to make bargains and contracts between other
persons in matters of trade, commerce and navigation, by explaining the intentions of
both parties, and negotiating in such a manner as to put those who employ him in a
condition to treat together personally. More commonly he is an agent employed by one
party only to make a binding contract with another.396.
A factor is entrusted with the possession as well as the disposal of property; a broker is
employed to contract about it without being put in possession.397.
6. 'Attorney'.—Is one who is appointed by another to do something in his absence, and
who has authority to act in the place and turn of him by whom he is delegated.398. The
High Court, while dismissing the revision petition, observed that it was possible that the
appellants were duped by the general power of attorney holder who knew that his
powers had been revoked but concealed the fact. If there any bona fides in the conduct
of the accused person, (by reason of revival of power), such arguments could have
made at the trial stage. The Court refused to interfere in the judgment.399.
7. 'Agent'.—Is a person employed to do any act for another, or to represent another in
dealings with third persons.400. An agent though bound to exercise his authority in
accordance with all lawful instructions which may be given to him from time to time by
his principal is not subject in its exercise to the direct control or supervision of the
principal.401. The trustee of a temple is an agent of the deity, and if he misappropriates
temple jewels he is guilty under this section.402. Where it is a servant's duty to account
for and pay over the moneys received by him at stated times, his not doing so wilfully
amounts to embezzlement.403. The term 'agent' is not restricted to persons who carry
on the profession of agents. The requirements of this section would be satisfied if the
person is an agent of another and that other person entrusts him with property or with
any dominion over property in the course of his duties as an agent. The entrustment
must be in connection with his duties as an agent.404. Where the appellant, an agent
entrusted with the distribution of the rice under the 'Food for Work Scheme' to the
workers on production of coupons was charged with misappropriation of 67.65
quintals of rice, the evidence proves that there was entrustment of property to the
accused, Court upheld the conviction.405.
[s 409.7] Commission agent.—
The accused was appointed as commission agent. Certain accounts were found to be
outstanding against the accused. The Court said that it was a dispute between a
principal and his agent of civil nature. The agent should not be harassed for such a
dispute by resort to criminal proceedings.406.
[s 409.8] Minister.—
Accused, the Minister for electricity and higher officials of Electricity Board alleged to
have awarded contract at a very high and exorbitant rate with special conditions having
heavy financial implications, by reducing the retention and security amount and by
allowing the contractor to return only fifty per cent of the empty cement bags. It is
found that accused persons have abused their official positions. Supreme Court set
aside the order of acquittal and convicted the accused.407.
[s 409.9] Independent contractor.—
An independent contractor was entrusted with a specific quantity of steel for purposes
of fabrication and erection of trolley. He fraudulently disposed of the steel contrary to
the terms on which possession was handed over to him. The Court said that he could
be treated as a trustee for the purposes of appropriate use of steel, in view of the
decision of the Supreme Court in Somnath v State of Rajasthan.408. He was guilty of
criminal breach of trust and liable to be punished under section.409.
[s 409.10] Insurance agent.—
Where an agent of the Life Insurance Corporation collected the premium amount from
the policy holder but did not deposit it with the corporation, his conviction for
misappropriation was held to be proper.410.
[s 409.11] Buyer of goods.—
Goods were delivered to a buyer in a sales transaction in the ordinary course of
business and he became the owner also because the vesting of property was not
linked with payment. It was held that he could not be held liable for misappropriating
his own property though his cheque, which was issued for payment of price afterwards,
bounced.411. Where the buyer refused to accept the shipment on premise that on a
random checking too many defects were found in the garments and complaint was
filed to recover the dues, Supreme Court held that the dispute between the parties is
civil in nature.412.
[s 409.12] Entrustment.—"
Entrustment" being a necessary part of the offence, where it is not proved, no offence
arises under this section.413. It is the settled law that mere proof of entries in the books
of account, unsupported by any evidence of receipt, is not alone sufficient to fasten the
accused with the offence of criminal breach of trust.414. An Assistant Engineer was
charged for criminal breach of trust for misappropriating Govt. Funds. It was found that
there was no entrustment of funds to the accused public servant. It was held that
question of misappropriation of funds does not arise.415. Accordingly, a school
inspector withdrawing money against false pay bills and misappropriating the entire
amount was held to be punishable for misappropriation and cheating but not of
criminal breach of trust because the amount withdrawn was not entrusted to him.416.
Where a postal delivery agent was given an insured cover supposed to contain Rs.
1000 and on delivery to the addressee, who opened the cover in the presence of the
agent, it was found that it contained blank papers, the agent was held not liable under
the section. The prosecution did not prove the most vital fact that at the time of
handing over to the agent, the cover did contain the amount in question.417. Where a
quantity of diesel oil which was delivered to a junior officer under his signature and he
embezzled it, his senior was not allowed to be prosecuted. There was no entrustment
to him. The fact that he exercised authority over the junior did not establish his
possession. The conviction of the senior was set aside, while that of the junior was
upheld.418. Where no account was produced as to the quantity of yarn entrusted and
how much was returned after making the finished product, it was held that there was
no infirmity in the order of acquittal.419.
[s 409.13] President of Co-operative Society.—
It has been held that the President of a Co-operative Society is not a public servant.
Dishonest retention of money of the society by the President was not an offence under
section 409. But section 406 was attracted.420. Secretary of co-operative society is not
a public servant within meaning of section 21 IPC, 1860 r/w.s. 8 of W.B. Co-operative
Societies Act, and no previous sanction is necessary for prosecuting him for offence
under section 409, IPC, 1860.421.
[s 409.14] Burden of proof.—
The prosecution has to prove that a public servant was entrusted with property which
he was duty bound to account for and that he misappropriated the property. Where the
fact of entrustment has been admitted or proved, the burden is then upon him to show
that the property was applied to the purpose for which it was entrusted to him.422.
[s 409.15] Amount repaid.—
The accused persons acting through directors of company in concert with the
Chartered Accountants and some other persons hatched a criminal conspiracy and
executed it by forging and fabricating a number of documents in order to support their
claim to avail hire purchase loan form the bank. The accused had not only duped the
bank, they had also availed of depreciation on the machinery, which was never
purchased and used by them, causing loss to the exchequer, a serious economic
offence against the society. Supreme Court had declined to quash the proceedings.
Merely because the dues of the bank have been paid up, the appellant cannot be
exonerated from the criminal liability.423.
[s 409.16] CASES.
Even a mistaken receipt of money by a public servant in official capacity does create an
obligation for the public servant to render an account of the money so received. All that
is required is entrustment or acquisition of dominion over property in the capacity of a
public servant. Thus where the accused, an official of the Indian Unit of Hindustan
Insurance Society who had no authority to collect premiums from Pakistani policy-
holders, did in fact represent to them that they could pay their premiums to him and
also issued receipts purporting to act in his official capacity and thereafter
misappropriated the money after making false entries in the relevant register, it was
held that he was guilty under section 409, IPC, 1860.424. It should, however, be
remembered that the prosecution has to prove that the public servant has acted
dishonestly in regard to property entrusted to him.425.
[s 409.17] Section 420 and 409.—Distinction.—
In 'criminal breach of trust', an accused comes into possession of a property or
acquires dominion over a property honestly and bona fide, but he develops dishonest
intention subsequent to the taking possession of, or subsequent to having acquired the
dominion over, the property and, having developed such dishonest intention, he
dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use the property or dishonestly
uses or disposes of the property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the
mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or
implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any
other person so to do. Thus, in 'criminal breach of trust', the intention of the accused
cannot be dishonest or mala fide at the time, when he comes into possession of the
property or comes to acquire dominion over the property; but, having come into
possession of, or having acquired dominion over, the property, the accused develops
dishonest intention and actuated by such mens rea, he converts to his own use the
property or dishonestly uses or disposes of the property in violation of any direction of
law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal
contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust,
or wilfully suffers any other person so to do. Contrary to what happens in "criminal
breach of trust", the intention of the accused, in a case or "cheating", is dishonest from
the very commencement of the transaction. There is really no consent by the person,
who is intentionally induced by deception to deliver the property or allow any person to
retain the property or is intentionally induced, as a result of deception, to do or omit to
do anything, which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived, and which
act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body,
mind, reputation or property. In short, thus, while in "criminal breach of trust", the
accused comes into possession of the property without dishonest intention and
develops dishonest intention subsequent to his coming into possession of the
property, the offence of 'cheating' is one, wherein the accused has dishonest intention
from the very commencement of the transaction.426.
[s 409.18] Section 409 and section 477A IPC, 1860.—
Contention of the accused is that scheme of sections 408 and 409 IPC, 1860 goes to
show that distinct offences have been provided respectively for the clerks or servants
and for the bankers and the present petitioner has been charged for the offence under
section 409 IPC, 1860 as he is a banker, but at the same time, he has been convicted
for the offence under section 477A IPC, 1860, where bankers have not been included in
the description of offence under section 477A IPC, 1860 and conviction under sections
477A and 409 IPC, 1860 cannot go hand to hand. The accused has been charged for
the offence under section 409 IPC, 1860 as he was public servant at the relevant time
being a Postal Assistant and his contention that he was a banker is misplaced. The
accused has not been charged as a banker.427.
[s 409.19] Director.—
A director of a company is not only an agent but also a trustee of the assets of the
company which come to his hand. Thus having dominion and control over property he
can come within the mischief of this section if he dishonestly misappropriates that
property to his own use.428. The manager of a rice mill was held liable under the
section for causing disappearance of a quantity of paddy from a huge stock of the
material entrusted to him.429.
[s 409.20] Directors of Company.—Vicarious liability.—
It is to be noted that the concept of 'vicarious liability' is unknown to criminal law. As
observed earlier, there is no specific allegation made against any person but the
members of the board and senior executives are joined as the persons looking after the
management and business of the appellant Company.430. The Penal Code does not
contain any provision for attaching vicarious liability on the part of the Managing
Director or the Directors of the Company when the accused is the Company. The
learned Magistrate failed to pose unto himself the correct question, viz., as to whether
the complaint petition, even if given face value and taken to be correct in its entirety,
would lead to the conclusion that the respondents herein were personally liable for any
offence. The Bank is a body corporate. Vicarious liability of the Managing Director and
Director would arise provided any provision exists in that behalf in the Statute. Statutes
indisputably must contain provision fixing such vicarious liabilities. Even for the said
purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the complainant to make requisite allegations
which would attract the provisions constituting vicarious liability.431. In the case of
Punjab National Bank v Surendra Prasad Sinha,432. a complaint was lodged by the
complainant for prosecution under sections 409, 109 and 114, IPC, 1860 against the
Chairman, the Managing Director of the Bank and a host of officers Since the principal
debtor defaulted in payment of debt, the Branch Manager of the bank on maturity of the
said fixed deposit adjusted a part of the amount against the said loan. The complainant
alleged that the debt became barred by limitation and, therefore, the liability of the
guarantors also stood extinguished. It was, therefore, alleged that the officers of the
bank criminally embezzled the said amount with dishonest intention to save
themselves from financial obligation. The Magistrate without adverting whether the
allegations in the complaint prima facie make out an offence charged for, in a
mechanical manner, issued the process against all the accused persons. The High
Court refused to quash the complaint and the matter finally came to Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed the proceedings and held that the
complaint was laid impleading the Chairman, the Managing Director of the Bank by
name and a host of officers. There lies responsibility and duty on the Magistracy to find
whether the concerned accused should be legally responsible for the offence charged
for. Only on satisfying that the law casts liability or creates offence against the juristic
person or the persons impleaded then only process would be issued.
[s 409.21] Society.—
The accused was in charge of a society's affairs. Shortage of funds was detected. It
was held that the fact that the accused agreed to make good the shortage at a later
point of time could not be treated as an admission of guilt on his part. Ingredients of
misappropriation were not made out. The mere discrepancy in amount was not
sufficient to sustain the conviction.433.
Prosecution has to prove entrustment and not how property was dealt with.—The
prosecution has to show that the property in question was entrusted to the accused. It
is then for the accused to show how he dealt with the property. 434.
[s 409.22] Previous sanction.—
In a prosecution against the Vice-chancellor of a University where section 50(2) of the
1994 University Act, 1904 says no prosecution will lie against the appellant without
previous sanction of the Syndicate, prosecution cannot be launched in the absence of
the previous sanction of the Syndicate.435. As far as the offence of criminal conspiracy
punishable under section 120-B, read with section 409 of the IPC, 1860 is concerned
and also section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, are concerned they
cannot be said to be of the nature mentioned in section 197 of the Cr PC, 1973.436.
[s 409.23] Punishment.—
The accused, working as an assistant accountant in a company, received on behalf of
the company certain recoveries from a firm but did not credit them in the account of
the said firm. He was found guilty and was convicted and sentenced to undergo RI of 1
and a half years under section 409 and RI of 1 and a half years under section 477-A.
The Apex Court upheld the conviction but considering time factor and age of the
accused, the sentence was reduced to six months, RI under each count.437.
The accused, a postmaster, was convicted under this section. The offence happened
15 years ago. He deposited the misappropriated amount with interest even before the
FIR was filed. He was punished only with fine of Rs. 4,000 without any
imprisonment.438.
[s 409.24] Moral turpitude.—
Undoubtedly, the embezzlement of Rs.5000 by the appellant, for which he had been
convicted under section 409 IPC, 1860, was an offence involving moral turpitude.439.
[s 409.25] Conviction of Employee under section 409.—will release on
probation remove the disqualification.—
Once a Criminal Court grants a delinquent employee the benefit of P.O. Act, 1958, its
order does not have any bearing so far as the service of such employee is concerned.
The word "disqualification" in section 12 of the Act 1958 provides that such a person
shall not stand disqualified for the purposes of other Acts like the Representation of
the People Act, 1950 etc. The conviction in a criminal case is one part of the case and
release on probation is another. Therefore, grant of benefit of the provisions of Act
1958, only enables the delinquent not to undergo the sentence on showing his good
conduct during the period of probation. In case, after being released, the delinquent
commits another offence, benefit of Act 1958 gets terminated and the delinquent can
be made liable to undergo the sentence. Therefore, in case of an employee who stands
convicted for an offence involving moral turpitude, it is his misconduct that leads to his
dismissal.440.
