Using as true a certificate known to be false.
Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to use any such certificate as a true certificate,
knowing the same to be false in any material point, shall be punished in the same
manner as if he gave false evidence.
COMMENT.â€”
This section is connected with section 197 just as section 196 is connected with
sections 193, 194 and 195.125. Appellant used the duplicate certificate with changes,
as a true certificate knowing it to be false in material particular and thereby got
admission in Polytechnic. Therefore, there is no reason to interfere with the conviction.
However, looking to the nature of the offence and the fact that the appellant's past and
present records have been good and the fact that he has already lost his career and is
now married, reduced the sentence to that already undergone.126.
