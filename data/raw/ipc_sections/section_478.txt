COMMENT.—
The offence under this section is an aggravated form of the offence described in the
preceding section. The forged document must be one of those mentioned in the
section. A complaint by the court is necessary for cognizance of the offence.47.
Section 467, IPC, 1860, does not require the prosecution to prove that the accused who
commits forgery, has benefitted thereby or any loss has occasioned to anyone
thereby.48. There is a fundamental difference between a person executing a sale deed
claiming that the property conveyed is his property, and a person executing a sale deed
by impersonating the owner or falsely claiming to be authorised or empowered by the
owner, to execute the deed on owner's behalf. When a person executes a document
conveying a property describing it as his, there are two possibilities. The first is that he
has a bona fide belief that the property actually belongs to him. The second is that he
may be dishonestly or fraudulently claiming it to be his even though he knows that it is
not his property. But to fall under first category of "false documents", it is not sufficient
that a document has been made or executed dishonestly or fraudulently. There is a
further requirement that it should have been made with the intention of causing it to be
believed that such document was made or executed by, or by the authority of a person,
by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made or executed. When a
document is executed by a person claiming a property which is not his, he is not
claiming that he is someone else nor is he claiming that he is authorised by someone
else. Therefore, execution of such document (purporting to convey some property of
which he is not the owner) is not execution of a false document as defined under
section 464 of the Code. If what is executed is not a false document, there is no
forgery. If there is no forgery, then neither section 467 nor section 471 of the Code is
attracted.49.
[s 467.1] Quashing of complaint.—
There were bold allegations in the complaint that the shares of the complainant had
been transferred on forged signatures. There was nothing to show how all or any of the
accused persons were involved. No offence was constituted under sections 406, 420,
467, 468 and 120-B. The order taking cognizance was held to be improper. It was
quashed in respect of accused persons who preferred special leave petition and also in
respect of those who did not file a petition.50.
[s 467.2] CASES.—
Where the allegation was that a company, acting through its directors in concert with
the chartered accountants and some other persons: (i) conceived a criminal conspiracy
and executed it by forging and fabricating a number of documents, like photographs of
old machines, purchase orders and invoices showing purchase of machinery in order to
support their claim to avail hire-purchase loan from Bank; (ii) on the strength of these
false documents, bank parted with the money by issuing pay orders and demand drafts
in favour of the Company; and (iii) the accused opened six fictitious accounts in the
banks to encash the pay orders/bank drafts issued by Bank in favour of the suppliers of
machines, thereby directly rotating back the loan amount to the borrower from these
fictitious accounts, and in the process committed a systematic fraud on the Bank and
obtained pecuniary advantage for themselves. Precise details of all the fictitious
accounts as also the further flow of money realized on encashment of demand
drafts/pay orders have been incorporated in the charge sheet additionally, by allegedly
claiming depreciation on the new machinery, which was never purchased, on the basis
of forged invoices, etc.; the accused cheated the public exchequer as well. The
Supreme Court held that proceedings are not liable to be quashed merely because
dues of bank have been paid up.51.
A deed of agreement for purchase of shares is not a valuable security.52. A person who
received money from a postman under a false representation that he was the payee
when in fact he was not, and signed the postal acknowledgement in the name of the
payee, was held to have committed an offence under this section.53. Where the
accused fraudulently brought into existence a registered sale deed, said to have been
executed by the widow of a person, intending to deceive and also to injure the
reversioners of that person, it was held that they were guilty under this section.54.
Where the accused falsely identified a person before the Oaths Commissioner as the
deponent and the said person affixed his thumb impression on the document and it
was also apparent that the document could not even become an affidavit without
identification of the deponent by the accused, it was held that the accused abettor
having been present at the time of the commission of the offence of impersonation he
was guilty under section 467 read with section 114, IPC, 1860.55. A bank draft is a
security for the purposes of this section and the bank manager signing a forged draft is
guilty of this offence.56. Making out cheques for withdrawing money for official
purposes and obtaining the signature of the signing officer under that pretence was
held to be punishable offence under this section.57.
[s 467.3] Bar under section 195(1)(b)(ii) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (Cr PC, 1973).—
Section 195(1)(b)(ii), Cr PC mandates that no court shall take cognizance of any
offence described in section 463, or punishable under sections 471, 475 or 476, of IPC,
1860, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in respect of a document
produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any court, except on the complaint in
writing of that court, or of some other court to which that court is subordinate. It
contemplates a situation where offences enumerated therein are committed with
respect to a document subsequent to its production or giving in evidence in a
proceeding in any court.58. The petitioner stood before the Court as surety in favour of
the accused person and filed the affidavit, bail declaration form and title document of
the Land record-of-rights book before the Court. It was further revealed that the
petitioner filed the false declaration as well as false affidavit in support of the said
declaration. It was further found that both the documents, i.e., the declaration form as
well the affidavit of accused were prepared just before production of them in the Court.
Admittedly, the offence was committed before the documents were filed in the Court.
Section 195(1)(b)(ii) of Cr PC would be attracted only when the offences enumerated in
the said provision have been committed with respect to a document after it had been
produced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any court, i.e., during the time when
the document was in custodia legis. This being the settled position of law, there
appears to be no justification in quashing the prosecution of the petitioner-accused on
the ground that provisions of section 195(1)(b)(ii) are applicable.59.
