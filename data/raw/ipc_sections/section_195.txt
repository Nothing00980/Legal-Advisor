record or electronic record or makes any document or electronic record containing a
false statement], intending that such circumstance, false entry or false statement
may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding,1 or in a proceeding taken by law
before a public servant2 as such, or before an arbitrator, and that such circumstance,
false entry or false statement so appearing in evidence, may cause any person who in
such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous
opinion touching any point material3 to the result of such proceeding, is said "to
fabricate4 false evidence".

COMMENT.—
The wording of this section is so general as to cover any species of crime, which
consists in the endeavour to injure another by supplying false data upon which to rest a
judicial decision.
[s 192.1] Ingredients.—
The offence defined in this section has three ingredients:—
(1) Causing any circumstance to exist, or making any false entry in any book or
record, or making any document containing a false statement.
(2) Doing one of the above acts with the intention that it may appear in evidence in
a judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law before a public servant or
an arbitrator.
(3) Doing such act with the intention that it may cause any person, who in such
proceeding, is to form an opinion upon the evidence to entertain an erroneous
opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding.43. From a
careful reading of section 192, IPC, 1860, what transpires is that whoever forges
a document, containing false statement or false entry, intending that such false
entry or false statement may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding, or in a
proceeding taken by law before a public servant as such, so appearing in
evidence, may cause any person, who, in such proceeding, is to form an opinion
upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion in such proceeding, he is
said to fabricate false evidence.44.
1. 'Judicial proceeding'.—The Code of Criminal Procedure says that 'judicial
proceeding' includes any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or may be
legally taken on oath [section 2(i)]. The power to take evidence on oath, which includes
affirmation as well,45. is the characteristic test of 'judicial proceeding'. 'Judicial
proceeding' means nothing more or less than a step taken by a Court in the course of
administration of justice in connection with a case.46. Execution proceedings are
judicial proceedings.47.
It is not essential that there should be any judicial proceeding pending at the time of
fabrication. It is enough that there is a reasonable prospect of such a proceeding
having regard to the circumstances of the case and that the document in question is
intended to be used in such a proceeding.48.
2. 'Public servant'.—The provisions of this section are not confined to false evidence to
be used in judicial proceedings, but to any proceeding before a public servant. A
Government correspondence was stealthily removed by accused No. 1 and handed
over to the pleader of accused Nos. 2 and 3. The correspondence was replaced by
accused No. 1. It was afterwards discovered that some papers had disappeared from
the correspondence whilst others had been either mutilated or altered. It was held that
accused Nos. 2 and 3 were guilty of offences under sections 466 and 193.49.
3. 'Material'.—The false evidence under this section should be material to the case in
which it is given though not so under section 191.50. The word 'material' means of such
a nature as to affect in any way, directly or indirectly, the probability of anything to be
determined by the proceeding, or the credit of any witness, and a fact may be material
although evidence of its existence was improperly admitted.51.
4. 'Fabricate'.—The term fabrication refers to the fabrication of false evidence; and if
the evidence fabricated is intended to be used in a judicial proceeding, the offence is
committed as soon as the fabrication is complete; it is immaterial that the judicial
proceeding has not been commenced,52. or that no actual use has been made of the
evidence fabricated. The mere fabrication is punishable under section 193; the use of
the fabricated evidence is punishable under section 196.
The evidence fabricated must be admissible evidence.53.
[s 192.2] Liability of accused for fabricating false evidence.—
It has been held by the High Courts of Calcutta54. and Bombay55. that an offender who
fabricates false evidence to screen himself from punishment is liable to be convicted
under this section. The Allahabad High Court56. has veered round to the same view,
after distinguishing an earlier case57. to the contrary.
[s 192.3] Vicarious liability.—
Neither section 192 IPC, 1860 nor section 199 IPC, 1860, incorporate the principle of
vicarious liability, and therefore, it was incumbent on the complainant to specifically
aver the role of each of the accused in the complaint.58. Penal Code does not contain
any provision for attaching vicarious liability on the part of the managing Director or the
Director for the Company when the accused is the company. Vicarious liability arise
provided any provision exits in that behalf in the statute. It is obligatory on the part of
the complainant to make requisite allegations which would attract the provision
constituting vicarious liability.59.
[s 192.4] CASES.—Fabrication of evidence to be used in judicial proceeding.—
The brother of an accused person applied to the Court on behalf of the accused asking
that the witnesses for the prosecution might first be made to identify the accused. The
Court assenting to this request, he produced before the Court ten or twelve men, none
of whom could be identified as the accused by any of the witnesses. Upon being asked
by the Court where the accused was, he pointed out a man who was not the accused. It
was held that he was guilty of fabricating false evidence.60. The accused, who was in
possession of the complainant's house as a yearly tenant, about the time the tenancy
came to an end, prepared another rent-note for a period of four years and got it
registered without the complainant's knowledge. It was held that the accused had
fabricated false evidence inasmuch as the rent-note, which contained an admission
against the interest of the accused, could be admitted in evidence on his behalf.61. By
swearing a false affidavit the accused makes himself prima facie liable under section
193 read with sections 191 and 192 of the IPC, 1860.62. In order to have the value of
CFC excluded for the purpose of excise duty, letters were fabricated and the same were
seized in a raid. Fifteen months later, taking up a notice of motion, High Court directed
filing of criminal complaints against the appellant under section 192. While agreeing
that the Division Bench was not wrong in making the direction, which it did on the
merits of the case, Supreme Court held that the High Court did not appear to have
bestowed sufficient attention while deciding upon the expediency contemplated by
section 340.63.
[s 192.5] No fabrication if no erroneous opinion could be formed touching any
point material to result of proceeding.—
It is now well settled that prosecution for perjury should be sanctioned by the Court
only in those cases where there is a prima facie case of deliberate and conscious
falsehood on a matter of substance and the conviction is reasonably probable or
likely.64. It is also very necessary that the portions of the witness's statement in regard
to which he has, in the opinion of the Court, perjured himself, should be specifically set
out in or form annexure to the show cause notice issued to the accused so that he is in
a position to furnish adequate and proper reply in regard thereto and be able to meet
the charge.65.
[s 192.6] No fabrication of evidence fabricated is inadmissible.—
The mere fact that a document would be ultimately inadmissible in evidence does not
necessarily take it out of the mischief of section 193.66.
