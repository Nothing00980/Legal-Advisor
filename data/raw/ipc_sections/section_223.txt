Commitment for trial or confinement by person having authority who
knows that he is acting contrary to law.
Whoever, being in any office which gives him legal authority to commit persons for
trial or to confinement, or to keep persons in confinement, corruptly or maliciously
commits any person for trial or to confinement, or keeps any person in confinement,
in the exercise of that authority knowing that in so doing he is acting contrary to law,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.â€”
This section is a further extension of the principle laid down in the preceding section. It
is general in its application, whereas the last section applies to judicial officers. In order
to bring home the charge under the section it must next be shown that the accused
corruptly or maliciously committed such person for trial or to confinement or kept him
in confinement in exercise of that authority knowing that in so doing he was acting
contrary to law. This analysis of the section by the Supreme Court occurs in a case in
which a police constable made the victims to alight from a bus and took them to a
nearby street. The Court said that at best it could amount to wrongful restraint but not
to wrongful confinement.335. Under section 220 IPC, 1860 it is necessary to establish
that the officer, who committed any person for trial or to confinement, must have acted
corruptly or malicious and knowing that he was doing that act contrary to law.336.
