Unlawful compulsory labour.
Whoever unlawfully compels any person to labour against the will of that person, shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
one year, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This section is intended to put a stop to the practice of forced labour. It requires—
(1) Unlawful compulsion of any person.
(2) The unlawful compulsion must be to labour against the will of that person.
This section is aimed at the abuses arising from forced labour which ryots were in
former times compelled to render to great landholders.
Where the accused induced the complainants who, he alleged, were indebted to him in
various sums of money, to consent to live on his premises and to work off their debts
and the complainants were to, and did in fact, receive no pay, but were fed by the
accused as his servants, and he insisted on their working for him, and punished them
by beating them if they did not do so, it was held that he was not guilty under this
section though his act came within section 352.1170.
Imposition of hard labour on persons undergoing imprisonment is legal. They can be
compelled to do hard labour.1171.
