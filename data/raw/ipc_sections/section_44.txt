Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences.
Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act,
they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.
ILLUSTRATION
A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would
be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and
intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing
Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z's death, B is guilty of murder,
and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.
COMMENT—
Section 38 provides that the responsibility for the completed criminal act may be of
different grades according to the share taken by the different accused in the
completion of the criminal act and this section does not mention anything about
intention common or otherwise or knowledge.271.
Sections 34–38 lay down principles similar to the English law of 'principals in the first
and second degrees.' See Comment on section 107.
The basic principle which runs through sections 32 to 38 is that in certain
circumstances an entire act is attributed to a person who may have performed only a
fractional part of it. This axiom is laid down in section 34 in which emphasis are on the
act. Sections 35–38 take up this axiom as the basis of a further rule by which the
criminal liability of the doer of a fractional part (who is to be taken as the doer of the
entire act) is to be adjudged in different situations of mens rea. Without the axiom
itself, however, the other sections would not work, inasmuch as it is the foundation on
which they all stand.272.
This section provides for different punishments for different offences as an alternative
to one punishment for one offence, whether the persons engaged or concerned in the
commission of a criminal act are set in motion by the one intention or by the other.273.
The section applies where a criminal act jointly done by several persons and the several
persons have different intentions or states of knowledge in doing the joint act.274.
Where three accused assaulted the deceased but only two used their weapons in a
determined manner which clearly showed their common intention to kill the deceased
and the third accused who had a lathi in his hand did not even use it to cause any injury
to the victim, it was held that the former two were liable to be convicted under section
302 read with section 34, IPC, 1860, and the third accused was only liable under
section 304, Part II read with section 38, IPC, 1860, as he had intentionally joined the
other two in the commission of the act with the knowledge that the assault was likely
to cause death of the deceased even though he did not have the intention to kill
him.275.
