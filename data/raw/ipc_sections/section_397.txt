Extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt.
Whoever commits extortion by putting any person in fear of death or of grievous hurt
to that person or to any other, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENTâ€”
If the fear caused is that of death or grievous hurt it naturally causes great alarm. The
section therefore, provides for severe penalty in such cases.
Where the accused wrote letters demanding ransom from the father of the boy whom
they kidnapped, putting the father in fright of the boy being murdered and there was
throughout the likelihood of the boy being murdered if the ransom money was not paid,
the accused were held guilty under this section.135.
