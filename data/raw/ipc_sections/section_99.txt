Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm caused.
The exceptions in sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences
independently of any harm which they may cause, or be intended to cause, or be
known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose behalf the
consent is given.
ILLUSTRATION
Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of
the woman) is an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended
to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence "by reason of such harm"; and
the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does
not justify the act.
COMMENT.â€”
The section serves as a corollary to sections 87, 88 and 89. It says in explicit terms that
consent will only condone the act causing harm to the person giving the consent which
will otherwise be an offence. Acts which are offences independently of any harm which
they may cause will not be covered by consent given under sections 87, 88 and 89, e.g.,
causing miscarriage, public nuisance, offences against public safety, morals, etc. It
may be stated here that the illustration given under this section has become somewhat
inappropriate as pregnancy can now be terminated under section 3 of Medical
Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, on a number of grounds and not only on the
ground of saving the life of the woman.
