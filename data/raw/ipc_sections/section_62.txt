Commutation of sentence of imprisonment for life.
In every case in which sentence of 164.[imprisonment] for life shall have been passed,
165.[the appropriate Government] may, without the consent of the offender, commute
the punishment for imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding
fourteen years.
COMMENT—
In the absence of an order under section 55 IPC, 1860 or section 433(b) Cr PC, 1973 a
life convict cannot be released even after expiry of 14 years, for a sentence of life
imprisonment means rigorous imprisonment for the rest of convict's life.166. It is now
conclusively settled by a catena of decisions that the punishment of imprisonment for
life handed down by the Court means a sentence of imprisonment for the convict for
the rest of his life.167. However, Supreme Court has been, for quite some time,
conscious of the liberal approach and sometimes discriminatory too, taken by the
States in exercise of their power under sections 432 and 433 of Cr PC, 1973 in
remitting or commuting sentences. In Jagmohan Singh v State of UP,168. Court had
expressed concern about such approach made by the States in remitting life sentences
that led to the amendment in Cr PC introducing section 433A by Act 45 of 1978. Under
section 433A of Cr PC, 1973 a sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed for an
offence for which death is one of the punishments or where a death sentence is
commuted to life under section 433, he shall not be released unless he has served 14
years of imprisonment.
It appears that the provision has been generally understood to mean that life sentence
would only be 14 years of incarceration. Taking judicial notice of such a trend, the
Supreme Court has, in cases where imposition of death sentence would be too harsh
and imprisonment for life (the way it is understood as above) too inadequate, in several
cases, has adopted different methods to ensure that the minimum term of life
imprisonment ranges from at least 20 years to the end of natural life. However, in some
cases, the Court had also been voicing concern about the statutory basis of such
orders.169. In the case of State of Rajasthan v Jamil Khan,170. the Supreme Court opined
that:
We are of the view that it will do well in case a proper amendment under section 53 of IPC is
provided, introducing one more category of punishment - life imprisonment without
commutation or remission. Dr. VS Malimath, J, in the Report on 'Committee of Reforms of
Criminal Justice System', submitted in 2003, had made such a suggestion but so far no
serious steps have been taken in that regard. There could be a provision for imprisonment
till death without remission or commutation.
[s 55.1] The power of High Court to commute.—
Exercise of power under section 433 is an executive discretion. The High Court in
exercise of its revisional jurisdiction had no power conferred on it to commute the
sentence imposed where a minimum sentence was provided for offence. The mandate
of section 433 Cr PC, 1973 enables the Government in an appropriate case to commute
the sentence of a convict and to prematurely order his release before expiry of the
sentence as imposed by the Courts.171. In State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) v Prem Raj,172.
Supreme Court was called upon to consider whether in a case involving conviction
under section 7 read with section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, the
High Court could commute the sentence of imprisonment on deposit of a specified
amount by the convict and direct the State Government to pass appropriate order under
section 433(c) Cr PC, 1973. It was held that the question of remission lay within the
domain of the appropriate government and it was not open to the High Court to give a
direction of that kind even if the High Court could give such a direction, it could only
direct consideration of the case of premature release by the Government and could not
have ordered the premature release of the respondent itself. The right to exercise the
power under section 433 Cr PC, 1973 vests in the Government and has to be exercised
by the Government in accordance with the rules and established principles. The
impugned order of the High Court cannot, therefore, be sustained and is hereby set
aside.173.
[s 55.2] Power to commute, when minimum sentence is provided in the
Statute.—
Punishment has a penological purpose. Reformation, retribution, prevention, and
deterrence are some of the major factors in that regard. Parliament is the collective
conscience of the people. If it has mandated a minimum sentence for certain offences,
the Government being its delegate, cannot interfere with the same in exercise of their
power for remission or commutation. Neither section 432 nor section 433 of Cr PC,
1973 hence contains a non-obstante provision. Therefore, the minimum sentence
provided for any offence cannot be and shall not be remitted or commuted by the
Government in exercise of their power under sections 432 or 433 of the Cr PC, 1973.
Wherever the Indian Penal Code or such penal statutes have provided for a minimum
sentence for any offence, to that extent, the power of remission or commutation has to
be read as restricted; otherwise the whole purpose of punishment will be defeated and
it will be a mockery on sentencing.174.
