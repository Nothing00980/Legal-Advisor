Agriculturist's Loans Act, 1884
Act 
No. 12 of 1884
1418.
 


Object and Reasons The object of this Bill is to repeal the Northern India Takkavi Act and re-enact it with certain amendments which appear to be desirable.
First.- The existing law makes no provision for recovery as an arrear of land revenue of interest on loans made under it and of the costs (if any)incurred by the Government in making the loans. Section 3 of Act X of 1879 only provides for the recovery in this way of the principal sum advanced. Section 5 of the Bill supplies this omission by providing that interest and costs (if any) may be recovered as arrear of land-revenue in the same manner as the principal.
Secondly.- Act X of 1879 extends to certain limited areas, namely the North Western Province and Oudh, the Punjab, the Central Provinces; Assam and Ajmer. At present there is no law in force in Bengal and Coorg under which advances of the nature of those with which the Act deals can be made. There are provisions relating to such advances in the laws in force in Bombay, Madras and British Burma; but the Local Government of Bombay and Madras are authorised to accept the extension of Northern India Act to their provinces; and the Chief Commissioner of British Burma says that if that Act is not extended in his province, it will be necessary to amend the law at present in force there in order to provide for the recovery of interest on advances. Provision has, therefore, been made in section 2 of the Bill empowering any Local Government, if it thinks fit, to extend the Act to the whole or any part of the territories under its administration.
Thirdly.- A new section 6 has at the request of the Punjab Government been inserted in the Bill similar to section 9 of the Land Improvement Loans. Act, 1883, recognising the principle of making loans on the joint responsibilities of village communities.
Lastly- As the term "Takkavi" is, it is understood, applied, in some parts of India to advances of the nature of those to which the Land Improvement Loans Act relates, it is proposed to alter the present title and to style the new Act 'The Agriculturists' Loans Act'. - Gazette of India, 1884, Part V, page 2.
