Accident in doing a lawful act.
Nothing is an offence which is done by accident 1 or misfortune, and without any
criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by
lawful means and with proper care and caution.
ILLUSTRATION
A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if
there was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an
offence.
COMMENT.—
This section exempts the doer of an innocent or lawful act in an innocent or lawful
manner and without any criminal intention or knowledge from any unforeseen evil
result that may ensue from accident or misfortune.48. To claim the benefit of this
provision it has to be shown:
(1) that the act in question was without any criminal intention or knowledge;
(2) that the act was being done in a lawful manner by lawful means; and
(3) that act was being done with proper care and caution.49.
1. 'Accident'.—An effect is said to be accidental when the act by which it is caused is
not done with the intention of causing it, and when its occurrence as a consequence of
such act is not so probable that a person of ordinary prudence ought, under the
circumstances in which it is done, to take reasonable precautions against it.50. An
accident is something that happens out of the ordinary course of things.51. The idea of
something fortuitous and unexpected is involved in the word 'accident.'52. Where two
brothers were sleeping together and one of them while in a state of semi-sleep felt that
somebody was throttling him, picked up the dao, kept on the head of the bed, and
administered a blow which was received by his sleeping brother who died, there being
neither intention nor motive, the accused was let off under this section. His act was not
voluntary.53.
An injury is said to be accidentally caused whensoever it is neither wilfully nor
negligently caused.54. Where the accused fired a shot at his assailant who escaped but
four other persons were injured and one of them unfortunately expired, it was held that
the accused was not liable for the fatal injury to an innocent person as his case fell
within the scope of section 80 read with sections 96 and 100, IPC, 1860.55. Shooting
with an unlicensed gun does not debar an accused from claiming immunity under this
section.56.
[s 80.1] Medical Negligence.—
To prosecute a medical professional for negligence under criminal law it must be
shown that the accused did something or failed to do something which in the given
facts and circumstances no medical professional in his ordinary senses and prudence
would have done or failed to do. The hazard taken by the accused doctor should be of
such a nature that the injury which resulted was most likely imminent.57. In Dr. Suresh
Gupta v Govt. of NCT of Delhi,58. the Apex Court held that where the medical practitioner
failed to take appropriate steps, viz., "not putting a cuffed endotracheal tube of proper
size" so as to prevent aspiration of blood blocking respiratory passage, the act
attributed to him may be described as negligent act but not so reckless as to make him
criminally liable. In Kusum Sharma v Batra Hospital and Medical Research Centre,59. the
Supreme Court reiterated the legal position after taking survey of catena of case law. In
the context of issue pertaining to criminal liability of a medical practitioner, it is laid
down that the prosecution of a medical practitioner would be liable to be quashed if the
evidence on record does not project substratum enough to infer gross or excessive
degree of negligence on his/her part. The criminal liability cannot be fastened on the
Medical Practitioner unless the negligence is so obvious and of such high degree that it
would be culpable by applying the settled norms.60.
[s 80.2] CASES.—
Deceased allegedly dashed by offending tractor and crushed by its wheels. The
Steering bolt of steering wheel was evidently broken all of a sudden. Offending vehicle
became free and was out of control. Incident was merely an accident and not an act of
rashness or negligence on the part of the accused.61. Where the act of the accused is
itself of criminal nature, the protection of this section cannot be availed. In this case,
the accused picked up his gun, unlocked it, loaded it with cartridges, aimed at the chest
of the victim from a close range of 4–5 feet and shot it. Quite naturally this section was
held to be not applicable. There could be no suggestion of an accident.62. Where the
Death is caused by shooting an arrow under bona fide belief that object aimed at was
an animal, accused is entitled to the benefit under sections 79 or 80.63. The accused
was attacked when he was asleep at night by his brother who tried to strangulate him.
Apprehending imminent death, the accused aimed a blow at his assailant brother with
a piece of bamboo on which he could lay hand and the blow accidentally struck the
head of his intervening father as a result of which he ultimately died. It was held that
the accused exercised his lawful right of self- defence and the blow fell on the head of
his father by accident and misfortune and he was fully protected by sections 80 and
106. His conviction under section 304 Part II was set aside.64.
[s 80.3] Burden of Proof.—
The prosecution alleges that the accused intentionally shot the deceased; but the
accused pleads that, though the shots emanated from his revolver and hit the
deceased, it was by accident, that is, the shots went off from the revolver in the course
of a struggle in the circumstances mentioned in section 80 of the IPC, 1860 and hit the
deceased resulting in his death. The Court then shall presume the absence of
circumstances bringing the case within the provisions of section 80 of the IPC, 1860,
that is, it shall presume that the shooting was not by accident, and that the other
circumstances bringing the case within the exception did not exist. But this
presumption may be rebutted by the accused by adducing evidence to support his plea
of accident in the circumstances mentioned therein. This presumption may also be
rebutted by admissions made or circumstances elicited by the evidence led by the
prosecution or by the combined effect of such circumstances and the evidence
adduced by the accused. But the section does not in any way affect the burden that lies
on the prosecution to prove all the ingredients of the offence with which the accused is
charged and that burden never shifts.65.

to remove the soil and became the victim of one spade blow of which he died. It was held that

304A being an act of criminal negligence. Sentence imposed upon him was reduced to the
period already undergone.
