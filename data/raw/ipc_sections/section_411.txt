COMMENTâ€”
This section provides for the punishment of those who belong to a gang of persons
who make it their business to commit dacoity. Its object is to break up gangs of dacoits
by punishing persons associated for the purpose of committing dacoity. The mere fact
that women lived as wives or mistresses with men who were dacoits was held not
sufficient to prove that they belonged to a gang of persons associated for the purpose
of habitually committing dacoity within the meaning of this section, unless it be proved
that the women themselves were associated with the husbands or protectors for the
purpose of themselves habitually committing dacoities.250.
The expression 'belong' implies something more than casual association for the
purpose of committing one or two dacoities by a person who was ordinarily living by
honest means. It refers to those persons who habitually associate with a gang of
dacoits and actively assist them in their operations. But if a person with a bad past
record participates in the commission of dacoity even on one occasion in association
with a well-known gang of habitual dacoits knowing them to be such a gang, it may be
reasonably inferred that he belongs to that gang unless there is some other material on
record to justify an inference that the association was of a casual nature.251.
The word 'gang' means any band or company of persons who go about together or act
in concert. The essence of the word is that the persons should act in concert.252.
Evidence that persons concerned were associated for the purpose of committing
dacoities in a number of cases during a short period of time is good enough evidence
to prove association within the meaning of this section even if such evidence was not
considered sufficient for conviction under section 395, IPC, 1860, in specific cases.253.
