COMMENT.—
Furnishing false information.—Section 176 deals with the omission to give information;
this section deals with the giving of false information. Persons who are not under a
legal obligation to furnish information cannot be dealt with under these sections.44.
Furnishing false information is distinct from omission to give information. Omission to
mention about a two-wheeler in the statement of assets and liabilities by a public
servant is not an offence under section 177 IPC, 1860.45. It is clear that the accused
having been aware of the fact that she belongs to "Havyak Brahmin" by caste, furnished
false information to the authority and obtained admission by producing false caste
certificate. The ingredients of section 177 are proved.46. In a case where the allegation
was that the complainant filed false information in nomination paper, it was held that a
complaint by the Returning officer is mandatory.47.
The appellant being a Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat was legally bound to give
correct information and issue a correct certificate but he issued a false certificate in
favour of one Lal Chand that he does not own any land except the land which he has
made fit for cultivation, in fact, though Lal Chand owned 13 kanals, 13 marlas and also
his wife owned lands in the village Baruhi. Therefore, the ingredients of section 177 of
the Code were proved as against him.48.

administratively subordinate. The provision of section 195(1), Cr PC, 1973 is
