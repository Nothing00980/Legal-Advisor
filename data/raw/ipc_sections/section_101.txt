Communication made in good faith.
No communication made in good faith is an offence by reason of any harm1 to the
person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person.
ILLUSTRATION
A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live.
The patient dies in consequence of the shock. A has committed no offence, though he
knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death.
COMMENT.—
This section protects the innocent without unduly cloaking the guilty.
The communication under this section must be
(1) made in good faith; and
(2) for the benefit of the person to whom it is made.
The illustration to this section does not say, however, whether the communication was
made to the patient for his benefit.
1. 'Harm'.—In this section 'harm' means an injurious mental reaction.245.
