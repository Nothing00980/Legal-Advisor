be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to

COMMENT—
Depredation.—The preceding section provides for waging war against any Asiatic
Power in alliance with the Government of India, this section prevents the commission
of depredation or plunder on territories of States at peace with the Government of
India. The scope of this section is much wider than the preceding section, for it applies
to a Power which may or may not be Asiatic.
