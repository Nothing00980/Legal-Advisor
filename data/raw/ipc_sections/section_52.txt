"Life".
The word "life" denotes the life of a human being, unless the contrary appears from
the context.
COMMENT—
Section 45 of the IPC, 1860 defines life as denoting the life of a human being, unless
the contrary appears from the context. Therefore, when a punishment for murder is
awarded under section 302 of the IPC, 1860, it might be imprisonment for life, where
life denotes the life of the convict or death. The term of sentence spanning the life of
the convict, can be curtailed by the appropriate Government for good and valid reasons
in exercise of its powers under section 432 of the Cr PC, 1973.320. Life imprisonment
cannot be equivalent to imprisonment for 14 years or 20 years or even 30 years, rather
it always means the whole natural life.321. The expression 'imprisonment for life' must
be read in the context of section 45, IPC, 1860.322. The Court may feel that the
punishment more just and proper, in the facts of the case, would be imprisonment for
life with life given its normal meaning and as defined in section 45 of the Indian Penal
Code.323.
[s 45.1] Imprisonment for the remainder of Accused's natural life.—
As per the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013324. the punishment for rape (section
376) is rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years, but
which may extend to imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the
remainder of that person's natural life, and shall also be liable to fine. In sub-sections 370,
376(A), 376(D), 376(E) also it is specifically mentioned that 'Life' shall mean
imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life. Parliament has enacted
the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 which provides for enhanced punishment in
rape cases. The Amendment Act provides stringent punishment for perpetrators of
rape particularly of girls below 12 years. Gang rape of a girl under 12 years of age is
now made punishable with a jail term for remainder of guilty person's natural life or
death. 325.
The right to claim remission, commutation, reprieve, etc., as provided under Article 72
or Article 161 of the Constitution will always be available, being guaranteed
Constitutional remedies, which are untouchable by the Court.326.
