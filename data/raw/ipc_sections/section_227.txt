Resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension.
Whoever intentionally offers any resistance or illegal obstruction to the lawful
apprehension of himself for any offence with which he is charged or of which he has
been convicted, or escapes or attempts to escape from any custody in which he is
lawfully detained for any such offence, 1 shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
Explanation.—The punishment in this section is in addition to the punishment for
which the person to be apprehended or detained in custody was liable for the offence
with which he was charged, or of which he was convicted.
COMMENT.—
This and the section following relate to resistance or illegal obstruction offered to the
lawful apprehension of any person. Sections 221–223 punish public servants who fail
to apprehend or confine persons liable to be apprehended or confined.
Section 224, IPC, 1860 has two distinct parts. The first relates to resistance to
apprehension and the second part relates to escape from custody. In order to bring
home the guilt of the accused under first part, the prosecution is to prove the following
ingredients:—
(1) that the accused was charged or convicted;
(2) that he offered resistance or obstruction to his apprehension;
(3) that such resistance or obstruction was illegal; and
(4) that the accused offered such resistance or obstruction illegally.
When the offence charged is that of escape or attempt to escape from custody, the
prosecution is to prove the following:
(1) that the accused was taken into custody for commission of an offence;
(2) that such detention in custody was lawful;
(3) that the accused escaped from such custody or made an attempt to do so; and
(4) that the accused did so intentionally.354.
1. 'Escapes...from any custody in which he is lawfully detained for any such offence'.—
Escape must be from the custody in which the person escaping has been detained
legally. A person of the same name as the offender was arrested, tried and acquitted.
Whilst under arrest he escaped from custody. It was held that he was not liable to be
convicted under this section because he was not lawfully detained for any offence.355.
It is only after a person has been arrested that the question of custody arises merely
because the person was brought to the thana for the purpose of interrogation it could
not be said that he was under lawful custody, even though two constables might be
sitting by his side.356. Where certain persons were apprehended for gaming and they
escaped from police custody, it was pointed out by the Supreme Court that they could
have been convicted under this section.357. Where the accused attacked the police
personnel and rescued a person from the legal custody of the police but the person
rescued neither resisted the arrest nor joined in the attack, he could only be convicted
under section 224 for taking advantage of his release.358. Where an accused lawfully
arrested escaped after causing a knife injury to the Head Constable, he was guilty
under section 224 and his friends who pelted stones at the police party with a view to
rescue him were guilty under section 225, IPC, 1860.359.
[s 224.1] Explanation.—
The Explanation does not require that a sentence of imprisonment must be made to
run consecutively to a sentence imposed for the main offence of which the accused
has been convicted.360.
