Force.
A person is said to use force to another if he causes motion, change of motion, or
cessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or
change of motion, or cessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with
any part of that other's body, or with anything which that other is wearing or carrying,
or with anything so situated that such contact affects that other's sense of feeling:
Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of
motion, causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the
three ways hereinafter described.
First.—By his own bodily power.
Secondly.—By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or
cessation of motion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of
any other person.
Thirdly.—By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move.
COMMENT.—
'Force' as defined in clause (1) contemplates the presence of the person to whom it is
used, that is to say, it contemplates the presence of the person using the force and of
the person to whom the force is used.961.
