Dacoity with murder.
If any one of five or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits
murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished with
death, or 193.[imprisonment for life], or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may
extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT—
Under this section extreme penalty of death may be inflicted on a person convicted of
taking part in a dacoity in the course of which a murder is committed, even though
there is nothing to show that he himself committed the murder or that he abetted it.
The section declares the liability of other persons as co-extensive with the one who has
actually committed murder. Where in the course of a dacoity one man was shot dead,
and the accused person who was tried had a gun and others of the dacoits also had
guns, and there was no evidence that the accused was the man who fired the fatal
shot, the sentence was altered from one of death to one of transportation for life.194.
[s 396.1] Ingredients.—
The offence under this section requires two things:—
(1) The dacoity must be the joint act of the persons concerned.
(2) Murder must have been committed in the course of the commission of the
dacoity.195.
Section 391 IPC, 1860 explains the offence of 'dacoity'. When five or more persons
conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, or where the whole number of
persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery, and persons present
and aiding such commission and attempt amount to five or more, every person so
committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit 'dacoity'. Under section 392 IPC,
1860, the offence of 'robbery' simpliciter is punishable with rigorous imprisonment
which may extend to ten years or 14 years depending upon the facts of a given case.
Section 396 IPC, 1860 brings within its ambit a murder committed along with 'dacoity'.
In terms of this provision, if any one of the five or more persons, who are conjointly
committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those
persons shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life or rigorous
imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to
fine.196. In the first instance, what is to be examined is whether the basic ingredient of
the offence falling under sections 395, 396 and 397 of IPC, 1860, namely, participation
of five or more persons was made out.197. On a plain reading of these provisions, it is
clear that to constitute an offence of 'dacoity', robbery essentially should be committed
by five or more persons. Similarly, to constitute an offence of 'dacoity with murder' any
one of the five or more persons should commit a murder while committing the dacoity,
then every one of such persons so committing, attempting to commit or aiding, by
fiction of law, would be deemed to have committed the offence of murder and be liable
for punishment provided under these provisions depending upon the facts and
circumstances of the case.198.
For recording conviction for dacoity, there must be five or more persons. In the absence
of such finding, an accused cannot be convicted for dacoity. In a given case, however, it
may happen that there may be five or more persons and the factum of five or more
persons is either not disputed or is clearly established, but the Court may not be able to
record a finding as to identity of all the persons said to have committed the dacoity and
may not be able to convict them and order their acquittal observing that their identity is
not established. In such case, conviction of less than five persons—or even one—can
stand. But in the absence of such finding, less than five persons cannot be convicted
for dacoity. A similar situation arises in dealing with cases of "unlawful assembly" as
defined in section 141 IPC, 1860 and liability of every member of such unlawful
assembly for an offence committed in prosecution of common object under section
149 IPC, 1860. In this case there were six accused. Out of those six accused, two were
acquitted by the trial Court without recording a finding that though offence of dacoity
was committed by six persons, identity of two accused could not be established. They
were simply acquitted by the Court. Therefore, as per settled law, four persons could
not be convicted for dacoity, being less than five which is an essential ingredient for
commission of dacoity. Moreover, all of them were acquitted for an offence of criminal
conspiracy punishable under section 120-B IPC, 1860 as also for receiving stolen
property in the commission of dacoity punishable under section 412 IPC, 1860. The
conviction of the appellant in this case for an offence punishable under section 396
IPC, 1860, therefore, could not stand and must be set aside.199.
[s 396.2] Presence of all not necessary.—
The section says that if "any one of five or more persons, who are conjointly
committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity" then every one of those
persons shall be liable to the penalty prescribed in the section. It is not necessary that
murder should be committed in the presence of all. When in the commission of a
dacoity a murder is committed, it matters not whether the particular dacoit was inside
the house where the dacoity is committed, or outside the house, or whether the murder
was committed inside or outside the house, so long only as the murder was committed
in the commission of that dacoity.200. The essence of an offence under this section is
murder committed in commission of dacoity. It does not matter whether murder is
committed in the immediate presence of a particular person or persons. It is not even
necessary that murder should have been within the previous contemplation of the
perpetrators of the crime.201. But in a case the dacoits were forced to retreat without
collecting any booty, the offence of dacoity would be completed as soon as they left
the house of occurrence and took to their heels. And if a murder was committed by any
one of the dacoits in course of such a retreat without any booty, then only the actual
murderer will be liable under section 302, IPC, 1860, and conjoint responsibility under
section 396, IPC, 1860, could not be fixed on others though all of them could be
convicted under section 395, IPC, 1860 as attempt to commit dacoity is also
dacoity.202.
[s 396.3] Number of Persons.—
Conviction for an offence of dacoity of less than five persons is not sustainable.203. For
recording conviction, there must be five or more persons. In absence of such finding,
an accused cannot be convicted for an offence of dacoity. In a given case, however, it
may happen that there may be five or more persons and the factum of five or more
persons is either not disputed or is clearly established, but the Court may not be able to
record a finding as to identity of all the persons said to have committed dacoity and
may not be able to convict them and order their acquittal observing that their identity is
not established. In such case, conviction of less than five persons — or even one can
stand. But in absence of such finding, less than five persons cannot be convicted for an
offence of dacoity.204.
[s 396.4] Presumption from recent possession.—
Simply on the recovery of stolen articles, no inference can be drawn that a person in
possession of the stolen articles is guilty of the offence of murder and robbery.205. The
nature of the presumption under Illustration (a) of section 114 of the Indian Evidence
Act, 1872 must depend upon the nature of evidence adduced. No fixed time-limit can
be laid down to determine whether possession is recent or otherwise. Each case must
be judged on its own facts. The question as to what amounts to recent possession
sufficient to justify the presumption of guilt varies according "as the stolen article is or
is not calculated to pass readily from hand to hand". If the stolen articles were such as
were not likely to pass readily from hand to hand, the period of one year that elapsed
could not be said to be too long particularly when the appellant had been absconding
during that period.206.
[s 396.5] Section 396 and Section 302.—
The ingredients of both these offences, to some extent, are also different in as much as
to complete an offence of 'dacoity' under section 396 IPC, 1860, five or more persons
must conjointly commit the robbery while under section 302 of the IPC, 1860 even one
person by himself can commit the offence of murder. But, as already noticed, to attract
the provisions of section 396, the offence of 'dacoity' must be coupled with murder. In
other words, the ingredients of section 302 become an integral part of the offences
punishable under section 396 of the IPC, 1860. Resultantly, the distinction with regard
to the number of persons involved in the commission of the crime loses its
significance as it is possible that the offence of 'dacoity' may not be proved but still the
offence of murder could be established, like in the present case. Upon reasonable
analysis of the language of these provisions, it is clear that the Court has to keep in
mind the ingredients which shall constitute a criminal offence within the meaning of
the penal section. This is not only essential in the case of the offence charged with but
even where there is comparative study of different penal provisions as the accused
may have committed more than one offence or even offences of a graver nature. He
may finally be punished for a lesser offence or vice versa, if the law so permits and the
requisite ingredients are satisfied.207. On the conjoint reading of sections 396 and 302
IPC, 1860, it is clear that the offence of murder has been lifted and incorporated in the
provisions of section 396 IPC, 1860. In other words, the offence of murder punishable
under section 302 and as defined under section 300 will have to be read into the
provisions of offences stated under section 396 IPC, 1860. In other words, where a
provision is physically lifted and made part of another provision, it shall fall within the
ambit and scope of principle akin to 'legislation by incorporation' which normally is
applied between an existing statute and a newly enacted law. The expression 'murder'
appearing in section 396 would have to take necessarily in its ambit and scope the
ingredients of section 300 of the IPC, 1860. The provisions are clear and admit no
scope for application of any other principle of interpretation except the 'golden rule of
construction', i.e., to read the statutory language grammatically and terminologically in
the ordinary and primary sense which it appears in its context without omission or
addition. These provisions read collectively, put the matter beyond ambiguity that the
offence of murder, is by specific language, included in the offences under section 396.
It will have the same connotation, meaning and ingredients as are contemplated under
the provisions of section 302 IPC, 1860.208.
[s 396.6] Charge under section 396.—Conviction under section 302.—
No prejudice has been caused to the appellant by his conviction for an offence under
section 302 IPC, 1860 though he was initially charged with an offence punishable under
section 396 IPC, 1860 read with section 201 IPC, 1860. The circumstances which
constitute an offence under section 302 were literally put to him, as section 302 IPC,
1860 itself is an integral part of an offence punishable under section 396 IPC, 1860.
Once the appellant has not suffered any prejudice, much less a serious prejudice, then
the conviction of the appellant under section 302 IPC, 1860 cannot be set aside merely
for want of framing of a specific/ alternate charge for an offence punishable under
section 302 IPC, 1860. It is more so because the dimensions and facets of an offence
under section 302 are incorporated by specific language and are inbuilt in the offence
punishable under section 396 IPC, 1860. Thus, on the application of principle of
'cognate offences', there is no prejudice caused to the rights of the appellant.209.
[s 396.7] Rarest of the rare.—
Five members of a family including two minor children and the driver were ruthlessly
killed by the use of a knife, an axe and an iron rod with the help of four other. The crime
was obviously committed after pre-meditation with absolutely no consideration for
human lives and for money. Even though the appellant was young, his criminal
propensities are beyond reform and he is a menace to the society. death sentence was
held to be the appropriate punishment.210. In a dacoity with double murder, the
accused had gained confidence of the lady of the house and other inmates and visited
them frequently. They committed dacoity after killing the lady and her grandson cold-
bloodedly and attempted to kill two others. Their guilt was proved duly by
circumstantial and direct evidence. The offences were found to be both heinous and
barbaric and it was a 'rarest of rare case'.211.

dacoity, the offence traverses from section 395 to section 396. Any person committing the
offence of dacoity with murder cannot be convicted and sentenced under both the sections,
