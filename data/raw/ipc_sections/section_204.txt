Causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false
information to screen offender—.
Whoever, knowing or having reason to believe that an offence has been committed,1
causes any evidence of the commission of that offence to disappear, with the
intention of screening the offender2 from legal punishment, or with that intention
gives any information respecting the offence which he knows or believes to be false;
if a capital offence;
shall, if the offence which he knows or believes to have been committed is
punishable with death, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine;
if punishable with imprisonment for life;
and if the offence is punishable with 132.[imprisonment for life], or with
imprisonment which may extend to ten years, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years,
and shall also be liable to fine;
if punishable with less than ten years' imprisonment.
and if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for any term not extending to
ten years, shall be punished with imprisonment of the description provided for the
offence, for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term of the
imprisonment provided for the offence, or with fine, or with both.
ILLUSTRATION
A, knowing that B has murdered Z, assists B to hide the body with the intention of
screening B from punishment. A is liable to imprisonment of either description for
seven years, and also to fine.
COMMENT.—
Object.—This section relates to the disappearance of any evidence of the commission
of an offence and includes also the giving of false information with the intention of
screening an offender. Sections 202 and 203 relate to the giving or omitting to give
such information, and section 204 to the destruction of documentary evidence.
There are three groups of sections in the Code relating to the giving of information.
First, sections 118–120 deal with concealment of a design to commit an offence;
second sections 176, 177, 181 and 182 deal with omission to give information and with
the giving of false information; and, third, sections 201–203 deal with causing the
disappearance of evidence.
[s 201.1] Scope.—
The Supreme Court has held that this section is not restricted to the case of a person
who screens the actual offender; it can be applied even to a person guilty of the main
offence, though as a matter of practice a Court will not convict a person both of the
main offence and under this section.133.
But, if the commission of the main offence is not brought home to the accused, then he
can be convicted under this section.134. Where it is impossible to say definitely that a
person has committed the principal offence he cannot escape conviction under this
section merely because there are grounds for suspicion that he might be the principal
culprit.135. A woman's husband and in-laws could not be convicted of murdering her
because there was no evidence whatsoever. They were convicted under this section
because they gave no reasonable explanation of the unnatural death and had also
disposed of the body in suspicious circumstances (dead body found near railway
track).136. The fact that the accused persons cannot be convicted for offence
punishable under section 302 IPC, 1860 does not extricate them from the offence
under section 201 IPC, 1860.137. In a case of bride burning, where the post-mortem
report was that death was due to throttling, burning her subsequently was held to be a
clear proof of the fact that the evidence of strangulation was sought to be destroyed by
the accused husband by pouring kerosene and setting her ablaze. The conviction of the
husband under sections 201, 302 and 498-A was held to be proper.138.
A statement given by a person in the course of an investigation by the police cannot
amount to an offence under this section and section 203, even if it ultimately turns out
to be false.139. The allegation against the appellant was that, he had deliberately
shielded the real offenders in the murder case and was accordingly liable for the
offence under section 201 of the IPC, 1860. Supreme Court acquitted the accused
holding that it is not possible on the evidence to ascertain, as to whether the appellant
was, in fact, guilty of the offence alleged against him.140.
The Supreme Court has held that where the evidence showed that a person had died
and his body was found in a trunk and discovered in a well, and that the accused had
taken part in the disposal of the body but there was no evidence to show the cause of
his death, or the manner or circumstances in which it came about, it was held that the
accused could not be convicted for an offence under this section.141. In other words,
the mere secreting of a dead body without first proving that the corpse secreted was
the corpus delicti of a murder case is no offence under section 201, IPC, 1860.142.
[s 201.2] Independent offence.—
A charge under section 201 of the IPC, 1860 can be independently laid and conviction
maintained also, in case the prosecution is able to establish that an offence had been
committed, the person charged with the offence had the knowledge or the reason to
believe that the offence had been committed, the said person has caused
disappearance of evidence and such act of disappearance has been done with the
intention of screening the offender from legal punishment. Mere suspicion is not
sufficient, it must be proved that the accused knew or had a reason to believe that the
offence has been committed and yet he caused the evidence to disappear so as to
screen the offender. The offender may be either himself or any other person.143. It has
been held that the offence under the section is of independent nature, though it cannot
be separated from the substance of the main offence. Accordingly, a conviction under
the section can be recorded even though the commission of the main offence is not
established. The Court, however, pointed out that such cases are likely to be very small
in number. Applying this to the facts of the case, the Court held that the accused was
guilty of offence under this section because he had buried the dead body of his wife in
his field and misguided the police of her disappearance, though, because of
decomposition, it could not be proved that he was responsible for her death.144.
[s 201.3] Ingredients.—
To bring home a charge under section 201, IPC, the prosecution must prove:—
(1) That an offence has been committed.
(2) That the accused knew or had reason to believe the commission of such an
offence.
(3) That with such knowledge or belief he
(a) caused any evidence of the commission of that offence to disappear, or
(b) gave any information relating to that offence which he then knew or
believed to be false.
(4) That he did so as aforesaid with the intention of screening the offender from
legal punishment.
(5) If the charge be of an aggravated form, it must be further proved that the
offence in respect of which the accused did as in (3) and (4) supra, was
punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment extending to ten
years.145.
1. 'Knowing or having reason to believe that an offence has been committed'.—It must
be proved that an offence, the evidence of which the accused is charged with causing
to disappear, has actually been committed,146. and that the accused knew, or had
information sufficient to lead him to believe, that the offence had been committed.147.
Unless the prosecution was able to establish that the accused person knew or had
reason to believe that an offence has been committed and had done something
causing the offence of commission of evidence to disappear, he cannot be
convicted.148.
Where the accused committed rape on a seven-year-old minor girl at his studio, killed
her and disposed of her dead body in a carton. The dead body of the deceased was
found in the carton, which the accused procured from witness. Conviction under
sections 302, 376 and 201 IPC, 1860 is maintained.149.
The charge framed was for causing disappearance for evidence. The fact that
concealment was the likely effect of the Act is not enough. There was no evidence to
attribute the knowledge of the death of the victim woman to the accused. Hence, the
essential ingredient of the offence was missing.150.
[s 201.4] Causing disappearance by preventing information from reaching
police.—
Where after raping a girl of 11 years the accused persons thrust a stick into her private
part of which she died and they falsely told the mother of the victim that they had
already reported the matter to the police and in the meantime there was disappearance
of evidence, they were held liable under this section.151. Where the Court has no case
that there is any intentional omission to give information by the accused to the police,
the conviction under section 201 cannot be maintained only on the ground that no
communication was given to the police and that the post-mortem had not been
performed. It is also no case of the complainant that he had requested for post-
mortem of the body and that intimation should have been given to the police before the
last rites were performed and there is also no charge under section 202 of the IPC,
1860 of intentionally omitting to give information of the unnatural death to the
police.152.
2. 'Intention of screening offence of offender'.—The intention to screen the offender
must be the primary and sole object of the accused. The fact that the concealment was
likely to have that effect is not sufficient.153. The accused person killed his brother and
his whole family in order to avoid partition of the joint family property. There was no
evidence to show that his son had common intention with him or participated in the
commission of the crime. But because he had seen his father commit multiple
murders, he tried to destroy the evidence by throwing away certain articles on two
occasions from over a bridge. It seemed obvious that he had done that with the
primary object of saving his father. He was convicted under this section.154.
Where a man shot down his wife with his pistol, his companion, who played no other
role, but concealed the authorship of the homicide, he was held guilty under this
section.155. Where the co-accused persons told the investigating officer that the
deceased was not present in the house at the material time, it was held that this
amounted to the offence of screening the offender.156.
[s 201.5] Cases.—
In the Jessica Lal murder Case157. the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of co-
accused under section 201 read with section 120-B IPC, 1860 considering the evidence
relating to their presence at the time of incident, removal of Tata Safari, his call details
etc. as well as the evidence of PWs 30 and 101. In another case where the accused
committed murder of his wife assaulting on her head with a chopper did cause the
evidence to disappear by setting fire to the dead body after pouring kerosene on her, it
is found that the accused has committed an offence punishable under sections 302
and 201 of IPC, 1860.158. Where unnatural conduct of appellants to dispose of dead
body of victim without having awaited for victim's husband who was already on his way
to home and the evidence shows that victim died under unnatural circumstances,
conviction under sections 302 and 201 IPC, 1860 is upheld.159. Where the accused
husband strangulated his young wife to death and attempted to destroy evidence by
burning her dead body, the order of acquittal of the accused of the offence under
sections 300 and 201 was reversed by the Apex Court.160.
[s 201.6] Help rendered to conceal crime.—
Where a person through fear did not interpose to prevent the commission of a murder,
and afterwards helped the murderers in concealing the body, it was held that he was
not guilty of abetment of murder but was guilty of an offence under this section.161. A
person who assists the actual murderers in removing the corpse of their victim to a
distance from the place where the murder was committed is prima facie guilty of an
offence under this section, until he can establish that he acted under compulsion.162.
Where it appeared from the statement of the accused that he took from the men who,
according to him committed the murder, a jewel which was unquestionably the
property of the deceased and he hid it and produced it later, it was held that the
accused, when he hid the jewel, had the intention of screening the offender, whoever he
was, from legal punishment and so was guilty of an offence under this section.163. The
death of a woman was caused on the first floor of the house and her mother-in-law, the
only other occupant of the house at the time of the occurrence, was residing on the
ground floor. The place of incident was intermeddled and bamboo pieces, rafters, and
broken tiles were thrown over the dead body with a view to cause disappearance of
evidence and to screen the offender. It was held that it was not possible without the
complicity of the mother-in-law and hence though she could not be held guilty of
murder or abetting it, she was guilty of an offence under section 201.164.
[s 201.7] Death in custody.—
Where there was death of a person in the police custody while he was detained there
for interrogation and his dead body was not traced, however, the evidence of other
witnesses who were also beaten up and injured by the police, categorically established
that the deceased became unconscious on receipt of injuries inflicted by the police and
died, it was held that an irresistible inference could be drawn that the police personnel
who caused the death, must also have caused the disappearance of the body.165.
[s 201.8] Bride burning.—
In a bride burning case, the victim was murdered and thereafter her body was burnt to
screen the offence. The guilt of the accused mother-in-law and that of the husband of
the victim as particeps criminis was established beyond any shadow of doubt. The
order of acquittal passed by the High Court from the offence of murder was reversed
and set aside and that of the trial Court convicting both the accused under section 300
was upheld. The mother-in-law was also convicted under section 201.166.
[s 201.9] False explanation by wife of death of husband.—
The accused wife attempted to explain away the death of her husband by saying that
he was attempting suicide and while she attempted to save him, he fell, down to death.
A search of her house showed evidence of murder. The Court said that even if she had
not herself caused death, she was in know of things and attempted to explain away the
incident by false explanations. The finding of guilt and her conviction under the section
could not be interfered with.167.
[s 201.10] Kidnapping, murder and concealment.—
The charge was that of Kidnapping the girl, murdering her and then concealing the
dead body. The police brought the accused to his house. He himself dug the place from
where the body was exhumed. The accused admitted that the house belonged to him.
The accused failed to explain how the body came to be buried in his house. The
Supreme Court confirmed his conviction under sections 300, 364 and 201.168.
[s 201.11] Disposal of dead body by burning.—
The fact that the accused, after killing his two minor daughters, threw their dead bodies
in the river, which amounted to causing disappearance of the evidence of murder.169.
[s 201.12] Failure of doctor to give information.—
The failure on the part of the doctor to give information to police for six days after the
admission of a burnt patient has been held not to constitute any offence under section
201 by itself.170.
[s 201.13] Threat to approver.—
Oral threat or inducement given by the two lady lawyers to the approver not to give any
statement against the petitioner, cannot amount to commission of an offence under
section 201 IPC, 1860.171.
[s 201.14] Sanction under section 197 Cr PC, 1973.—
In a case where the allegation was that HIV contaminated blood was supplied to the
Government Medical College Hospital and as a result, some patients who were given
blood transfusion had tested HIV positive. Accused tampered with the entries made in
official register, tearing of pages from the different official registers and stowing them
away in house. The acts cannot be related to the discharge of his official duties and
hence sanction for prosecution under section 197 Cr PC, 1973 not required.172.
[s 201.15] Acquittal for main offence, conviction under section 201.—
One Palvinder Kaur was tried for offence under sections 302 and 201 Penal Code and
was convicted under section 302 IPC, 1860 but no verdict was recorded regarding the
charge under section 201 Penal Code. In appeal, High Court acquitted her of the charge
of murder, but convicted under section 201 of Penal Code. In the appeal before
Supreme Court, it was held that in order to establish the charge under section 201 IPC,
1860 it is essential to prove that substantive offence has been committed and the
accused knew or had reason to believe that such offence has been committed with
requisite knowledge and intention of screening the offender from such legal
punishment, caused any evidence of the commission of that offence to disappear or
gave any information respecting such offence or having such knowledge or believed to
be false. She is acquitted under section 201 IPC, 1860.173. Conviction for causing
disappearance of evidence is possible even if nobody has been convicted for the main
offence.174. Where the allegation was that the appellant killed his wife with a bamboo
stick and buried her dead body in dry portion of pond located in his compound and
there was no mark of injury found on the dead body; Court held that the possibility that
deceased committed suicide by consuming poison cannot be ruled out. Though he was
acquitted under section 302, but was convicted under section 201 IPC, 1860.175.
[s 201.16] Main accused died during pendency of trial.—
Where main accused died during pendency of trial, conviction of co-accused for
causing disappearance of evidence is held not proper.176.
[s 201.17] CASES.—
however, submitted with respect that having regard to the decisions of the Supreme
Court in the cases of Om Prakash,177. and Abhayanand,178. where it has been held that
to constitute an attempt to commit an offence it is not essential that the last proximate
act must be done by the accused, in the instant case too the accused could perhaps be
held guilty of an attempt to cause disappearance of the evidence of murder under
sections 201/511, IPC, 1860, as they, in fact, did all that lay within their power to do
towards causing disappearance of the evidence of murder but the plot failed as the
police intervened in the matter. Where the members of an unlawful assembly
indiscriminately killed five persons, dragged the dead bodies over a distance, beheaded
the victims and threw their limbs and bodies in the raging fire, they not only committed
an offence under section 201, IPC, 1860, but were also liable under sections 302/149,
IPC, 1860.179. If murder of an illegitimate child remains unproved, mere secreting of the
dead body of the child does not constitute an offence under section 201 IPC, 1860.180.
Where the complaint filed under section 201, IPC, 1860, besides mentioning the section
did not contain a single word as to how the evidence of the crime was destroyed, it was
held that no cognizance could be taken on such a complaint as it did not even contain
allegations to constitute the offence under section 201, IPC, 1860.181. Mere removal of
dead body from one place to another does not by itself amount to causing
disappearance of evidence under section 201, IPC, 1860.182. Where the dead bodies
were disposed of by some of the members of the unlawful assembly, all of them could
be convicted under section 201 read with section 149, IPC, 1860.183. Where the
accused cremated the dead body of his wife who had committed suicide without
informing the police, the accused was held liable under section 201 in spite of he being
acquitted under sections 304-B and 498-A.184.
