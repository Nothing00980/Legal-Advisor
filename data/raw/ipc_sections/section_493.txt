COMMENT.—
To succeed on the charges under sections 482 and 486 the complainant had to
establish that the appellant marked the scent manufactured and sold by him, or the
packets and receptacles containing such scent or used packets or receptacles bearing
that mark, and that he did so in a manner reasonably calculated to cause it to be
believed that the goods so marked or the scent contained in the packets and
receptacles so marked belong to the complainant.112.
