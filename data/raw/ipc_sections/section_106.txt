Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind,
etc.
When an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by
reason of the youth, the want of maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind
or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on
the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against
that act which he would have if the act were that offence.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A
has the same right of private defence which he would have if Z were sane.
(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter Z, in good faith, taking
A for a house-breaker, attacks A. Here Z, by attacking A under this misconception,
commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which he
would have if Z were not acting under that misconception.
COMMENT.â€”
The right of private defence would have lost most of its value if it was not allowed to be
exercised against persons suffering from the incapacities mentioned in this section.
