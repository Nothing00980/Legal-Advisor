Making preparation to commit dacoity.
Whoever makes, any preparation for committing dacoity, shall be punished with
rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be
liable to fine.
COMMENT—
This section makes preparation to commit dacoity punishable. 'Preparation' consists in
devising or arranging means necessary for the commission of an offence.240.
Under the Code preparation to commit an offence is punishable in three cases:—
(1) Preparation to wage war against the Government of India (section 122).
(2) Preparation to commit depredation on territories of a Power at peace with the
Government of India (section 126).
(3) Preparation to commit dacoity.
In a popular sense assembling to commit dacoity may be an act of preparation for it,
but a mere assembly, without further preparation, is not 'preparation' within the
meaning of this section. Section 402 applies to mere assembling without proof of other
preparation. A person may not be guilty of dacoity, yet guilty of preparation, and not
guilty of preparation, yet guilty of assembling.241.
[s 399.1] Distinction between sections 399 and 402.—
Though the offences falling under both the sections, more or less, involve similar
ingredients, the only difference between the two is that while under section 402 mere
assemblage without preparation is enough, section 399 require some additional steps
by way of preparation. There can be cases where there may be an assembly for the
purpose of dacoity without even a fringe of preparation. The mere fact that the
appellants are acquitted of the charge under section 399 is no ground to knock off the
charge under section 402, IPC, 1860.242. In order to establish an offence punishable
under section 399, IPC, 1860 some act amounting to preparation must be proved and
what must be proved further is an act for which preparation was being made was a
dacoity, that is to say, robbery to be committed by five or more persons. The
prosecution has to establish under section 402, IPC, 1860 that there had been an
assembly of five or more persons constituted for the purpose of committing dacoity
and that the accused persons were members of that assembly. If there is no clear and
acceptable evidence of any assemblage of the appellants with three or more persons
for the purpose of committing dacoity then the appellants cannot be held liable under
section 402, IPC, 1860.243.
[s 399.2] Distinction between attempt and preparation.—
A culprit first intends to commit the offence, then makes preparation for committing it
and thereafter attempts to commit the offence. If the attempt succeeds, he has
committed the offence; if it fails due to reasons beyond his control, he is said to have
attempted to commit the offence. Attempt to commit an offence can be said to begin
when the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do something with
the intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of
the offence. The moment he commences to do an act with the necessary Intention, he
commences his attempt to commit the offence. The word "attempt" is not itself
defined, and must, therefore, be taken in its ordinary meaning. This is exactly what the
provisions of section 511 require. An attempt to commit a crime is to be distinguished
from an intention to commit it and from preparation made for its commission. Mere
intention to commit an offence, not followed by any act, cannot constitute an offence.
The will is not be taken for the deed unless there be some external act which shows
that progress, has been made in the direction of it, or towards maturing and effecting it.
Intention is the direction of conduct towards the object chosen upon considering the
motives which suggest the choice. Preparation consists in devising or arranging the
means or measures necessary for the commission of the offence. It differs widely from
attempt which is the direct movement towards the commission after preparations are
made. Preparation to commit an offence is punishable only when the preparation is to
commit offences under section 122 (waging war against the Government of India) and
section 399 (preparation to commit dacoity). The dividing, line between a mere
preparation and an attempt is sometimes thin and has to be decided on the facts of
each case. There is a greater degree of determination in attempt as compared with
preparation.244.
[s 399.3] CASES.—
Where it is proved that the accused, who were residents of different villages had
gathered with lethal arms at an unearthly hour in a desolate place under a tree with no
explanation for their conduct whatsoever much less an acceptable one, the Court
found them guilty under sections 399 and 402.245.
Where a number of persons were sitting in a Railway waiting hall at about 9.30 at night
and a country-made gun without any cartridge, a whistle and a torch of five cells were
recovered from their possession, it could not be said without any other evidence that
they had made preparation to commit dacoity within the meaning of this section nor
would it amount to an offence of assemblage for the purpose of committing dacoity
under section 402.246. The mere fact that eight persons were found in a school at
about 1 a.m. and some of them were armed does not make out a case either under
section 399 or under section 402, IPC, 1860, unless it is shown that they assembled
there for the purpose of committing dacoity. In such a situation the possibility that they
had so assembled there for murdering somebody or committing some other offence
cannot be ruled out.247. In this connection see also Comments under section 402, IPC,
1860, especially the case of Naushera therein.
[s 399.4] Sentence.—
The occurrence had taken place twenty nine years ago and the appellant has remained
in custody for a period of more than six months. The Supreme Court while upholding
the conviction of the appellant, sentence of imprisonment awarded against him is
reduced to the period already undergone by him.248.

243. Asgar v State of Rajastan, 2003 Cr LJ 1997 ; In Karam Dass v State, AIR 1952 Pun 249 :
1952 Cr LJ 1119 , the Punjab High Court held that to bring the case within section 399 of the
Code, it is not necessary that persons shown to be making the preparations should be five or
more in number. It is, however, necessary for the prosecution to prove that the raid for which the
persons prosecuted were making preparation was to be committed by five or more persons, for
otherwise it would not be dacoity but merely robbery, and mere preparation for committing
robbery, unless it ends in an actual attempt, is not punishable by law.
