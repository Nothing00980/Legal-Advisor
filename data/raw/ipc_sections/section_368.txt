COMMENT.â€”
Where there was sufficient evidence to show that the victim woman was abducted
from her house and then taken to different places which included confinement to one
place till she was recovered by the police, it was held that the accused could be
convicted under this section and section 368 but not section 366.1107.
The prosecutrix had left her home voluntarily, of her own free will to get married to the
appellant. She was 19 years of age at the relevant time and was, hence, capable of
understanding the complications and issues surrounding her marriage to the appellant.
According to the version of events provided by her, the prosecutrix had called the
appellant on a number given to her by him, to ask him why he had not met her at the
place that had been pre-decided by them. Offence not made out.1108.
In the order of extradition section 364A mentioned and not section 365 IPC, 1860.
Offence under section 365 IPC, 1860 is lesser offence than the offence punishable
under section 364A IPC, 1860. Hence, protection of accused and trial for lesser offence
under section 365 IPC, 1860 cannot be held to be without authority of law.1109.
