Giving false evidence.
Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law to state the
truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject,1 makes any
statement which is false,2. and which he either knows or believes to be false or does
not believe to be true,3. is said to give false evidence.
Explanation 1.—A statement is within the meaning of this section, whether it is made
verbally or otherwise.
Explanation 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the
meaning of this section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by
stating that he believes a thing which he does not believe, as well as by stating that he
knows a thing which he does not know.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one thousand rupees,
falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z admit the justice of B's claim. A has
given false evidence.
(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain
signature to be the handwriting of Z, when he does not believe it to be the
handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore
gives false evidence.
(c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a
certain signature to be the handwriting of Z; A in good faith believing it to be so.
Here A's statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and
therefore, although the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not
given false evidence.
(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at
a particular place on a particular day, not knowing anything upon the subject. A
gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not.
(e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true interpretation or
translation of a statement or document which he is bound by oath to interpret or
translate truly, that which is not and which he does not believe to be a true
interpretation or translation. A has given false evidence.
COMMENT.—
Ingredients.—The offence under this section involves three ingredients:—
(1) A person must be legally bound;
(a) by an oath, or any express provision of law, to state the truth; or
(b) to make a declaration upon any subject.
(2) He must make a false statement.
(3) He must;
(a) know or believe it to be false, or
(b) not believe it to be true.
1. 'Legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law, etc.'— In case the
recourse to a false plea is taken with an oblique motive, it would definitely hinder,
hamper or impede the flow of justice and prevent the Courts from performing their
legal duties.2 The Courts have to follow the procedures strictly and cannot allow a
witness to escape the legal action for giving false evidence before the Court on mere
explanation that he had given it under the pressure of the police or for some other
reason. Whenever the witness speaks falsehood in the Court, and it is proved
satisfactorily, the Court should take a serious action against such witnesses.3 It is
necessary that the accused should be legally bound by an oath before a competent
authority. If the Court has no authority to administer an oath the proceeding will be
coram non judice and a prosecution for false evidence will not stand.4. Similarly, if the
Court is acting beyond its jurisdiction it will not be sustained.5. For the essentiality of
section 191, petitioner must have been legally bound to speak truth or make a
declaration and he must have stated or declared what is false. He must also know or
believe what he has stated or declared is false or he has believed it true. If there is no
compulsion to make any declaration as required by law, Section 191 will not have any
application. The information given by him is not on any oath nor was he bound to give
such information under any provision of Law.6.
[s 191.1] 'By an oath'.—
An oath or a solemn affirmation is not a sine qua non in the offence of giving false
evidence.7. The offence may be committed although the person giving evidence has
been either sworn or affirmed.8. Whenever in a Court of law a person binds himself on
oath to state the truth, he is bound to state the truth and he cannot be heard to say that
he should not have gone into the witness box or should not have made an affidavit. It is
no defence to say that he was not bound to enter the witness box.9.
[s 191.2] 'By an express provision of law'.—
Under this clause sanction of an oath is not necessary; there must be a specific
provision of law compelling a person to state the truth. Where the accused is not bound
by an express provision of law to state the truth he cannot be charged with giving false
evidence.10.
[s 191.3] 'Declaration upon any subject'.—
In certain cases the law requires a declaration from a person of verification in a
pleading—and if such a declaration is made falsely it will come under this clause. The
words 'any subject' denote that the declaration must be in connection with a subject
regarding which it was to be made.
2. 'Any statement which is false'.—It is not necessary that the false evidence should be
material to the case in which it is given.11. If the statement made is designedly false,
the accused is liable whether the statement had a material bearing or not upon the
matter under enquiry before the Court.12.
3. 'Knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true'.—The matter sworn to
must be either false in fact, or, if true, the accused must not have known it to be so. The
making of a false statement, without knowledge as to whether the subject-matter of
the statement is false or not, is legally the giving of false evidence.13. Where a man
swears to a particular fact, without knowing at the time whether the fact be true or
false, it is as much perjury as if he knew the fact to be false, and equally indictable.14.
However, a man cannot be convicted of perjury for having acted rashly, or for having
failed to make reasonable inquiry with regard to the facts alleged by him to be true.15.
[s 191.4] Two Contradictory Statements.—
Merely because a person makes two contradictory statements, one of which must be
false, it does not make out a case of perjury unless the falsity of one of the two
statements as charged in the indictment is positively proved to be so.16. In India a
prosecution for perjury seems to be possible in such a case by virtue of illustration (e)
of section 221, The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it has been held to be
inexpedient to do so in the interest of justice. Thus, where a person made one
statement under section 164 Cr PC, 1973 and a diametrically opposite statement in
Court during the enquiry or trial, he could in view of this illustration be charged in the
alternative and convicted of intentionally giving false evidence, although it cannot be
proved which of these contradictory statements was false. But to do so may be to tie
him down to his previous false statement under section 164 Cr PC, 1973, and
preventing him from telling the truth even belatedly at the later stage of enquiry or trial.
The Supreme Court too has felt that a witness whose statement has been recorded
under section 164 Cr PC, 1973, feels tied to his previous statement and as such his
evidence has to be approached with caution.17. In the instant case as it could not be
shown that the earlier statements of the witnesses recorded under section 164 Cr PC,
1973 were true and those given before the Magistrate in course of the enquiry were
false, the complaints of perjury filed against the witnesses were directed to be
withdrawn.18.
[s 191.5] As to expert opinion.—
A scientific expert was asked to give his opinion regarding two cartridges, whether
those were fired from one firearm or from two different ones, without sending the
suspected firearm to him. He gave opinion, inter alia, that no definite opinion could be
offered in order to link the firearm unless the firearm was made available to him. During
the examination, the Court insisted him to give a definite opinion that too without
examining the firearm. At that time, he opined that the cartridges appeared to have
been fired from two separate firearms. Considering that there was a deliberate
deviation in his opinion the High Court initiated proceedings against him under section
340 Cr PC, 1973 for perjury. The Supreme Court held that it is unjust, if not unfair, to
attribute any motive to the appellant that there was a somersault from his original
stand in the written opinion.19.
[s 191.6] Written statements and applications.—
A person filing a written statement in a suit is bound by law to state the truth, and if he
makes a statement which is false to his knowledge or belief, or which he believes not
be to true, he is guilty of this offence.20. Signing and verifying an application for
execution containing false statements is an offence under this section, and it makes no
difference that at the time when the signature and verification were appended the
application was blank.21. But the verification of an application, in which the applicant
makes a false statement, does not subject him to punishment for this offence, if such
application does not require verification.22.
[s 191.7] Incriminating statement no justification.—
When a party makes a false statement while legally bound by solemn affirmation, the
fact that the statement was one tending to incriminate himself will not justify his
acquittal on a charge of giving false evidence.23.
[s 191.8] Illegality of trial does not purge perjury.—
The fact that the trial in which false evidence is given is to be commenced de novo
owing to irregularity does not exonerate the person giving false evidence in that trial
from the obligation to speak the truth, and he is liable for giving false evidence.24.
[s 191.9] Prosecution for perjury.—
It has been held by the Supreme Court that the courts should sanction the prosecution
for perjury only in those cases where perjury appears to be deliberate and where it
would be expedient in the interest of justice to punish the delinquent and not merely
because there is some inaccuracy in the statement.25.
[s 191.10] Accused not liable for giving false evidence.—
The authors of the Code observe:
We have no punishment for false evidence given by a person when on his trial for an
offence, though we conceive that such a person ought to be interrogated... If A stabs Z,
and afterwards on his trial denies that he stabbed Z, we do not propose to punish A as
a giver of false evidence.26.
The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer questions
put by the Court or by giving false answers to them.27.
[s 191.11] CASES.—
In a case, where the allegation was that the Attorney General and Chief Vigilance
Officer gave consent to prosecute the Complainant without due care and without
proper application of mind. The Supreme Court held that it cannot be said that the
document conveying consent was a 'false document' or that giving of 'consent'
amounted to giving of 'false evidence' or 'fabricating false evidence' at any stage of
judicial proceeding.28. A person could only be held guilty of an offence under section
191 if false evidence is knowingly given or when the statement is believed to be not
true.29. A witness falsely deposing in another's name;30. and a person falsely verifying
his plaint;31. and an official making a false return of the service of summons,32. were
held guilty of giving false evidence. The Supreme Court has held that where a false
affidavit is sworn by a witness in a proceeding before a Court the offence would fall
under this section and section 192. It is the offence of giving false evidence or of
fabricating false evidence for the purpose of being used in a judicial proceeding.33.
Where a notice of perjury was issued to certain eye-witnesses but it could not be
shown with certainty that they were liars, it was held that the issue of notices was not
proper. The Court used its inherent powers and quashed the notices. The challenge
was presented by only one of the witnesses on his own behalf as well as that of
others.34.
[s 191.12] Affidavit.—
An affidavit is evidence within the meaning of section 191 of the IPC, 1860. It was
alleged about an affidavit filed in a Court that it contained false statements. The
affidavit was filed by the party suo motu and not under direction from the Court. Such
an affidavit could not be termed as evidence. Hence, no action could be taken against
him under the IPC, 1860.35. Process Server while he takes information from the
neighbours is not expected to get a sworn statement from them. It is neither an
affidavit nor a sworn statement. It is only an information, which he has collected to
show his bona fides that he made attempts to serve the notice on the party. If on the
request of process server if any such information is given that information cannot be
treated as false evidence or fabricating evidence nor it could be treated as certificate
nor a declaration under any of the provisions of this section.36.
[s 191.13] Abetment.—
Where an accused asked a witness to suppress certain facts in giving his evidence
against him (accused), it was held that he was guilty of abetment of giving false
evidence in a stage of a judicial proceeding.37. Where C falsely represented himself to
be U, and the writer of a document signed by U, and T, knowing that C was not U and
had not written such document, adduced C as U, the writer of that document, it was
held that T was guilty of abetment of giving false evidence.38.
[s 191.14] Bar under section 195 Cr PC, 1973.—
Section 195 of the Code lays down the procedure for prosecution for contempt of
lawful authority of public servants for offences against public justice and for offences
against public documents given in the form of evidence. As per this provision, Court is
debarred from taking cognizance of any of the offences punishable under sections
193–196, 199, 200, 205–211 and section 228, when such offence is alleged to have
been committed in, or in relation to, any proceedings in any Court except on the
complaint in writing of that Court by such officer of the Court as that Court may
authorise in writing in that behalf or of some other Court to which that Court is
subordinate. The term "Court" in the section means a Civil, Revenue or Criminal Court
and includes a tribunal. Section 340 of the Code prescribes the procedure to be
followed for offences mentioned in section 195 of the Code. Therefore, the summoning
orders of the Magistrate against the petitioners under sections 193/191/209 IPC, 1860
are hit by provisions of section 195 of the Code and the cognizance taken by the
Magistrate of the offences is, therefore, without jurisdiction.39. Sections 191 and 192 of
the IPC, 1860 are the sections that define offences for which punishment is provided
for in sections 193 and 195 as mentioned in section 195(1)(b) (i), Criminal Procedure
Code. So the bar to initiate proceedings is applicable to sections 191 and 192 also.40.
[s 191.15] Procedure.—
A combined reading of the aforequoted provisions of Cr PC, 1973 and IPC, 1860 as
also sub-section (3) of section 195, Cr PC, 1973 makes this legal position quite clear
that they are applicable to any legal proceeding before a Civil Court or a Criminal Court,
including a Tribunal constituted by Central, Provincial or State Acts, if declared by that
particular Act to be a Court for the purpose of section 195, Cr PC, 1973. Therefore, if
the Family Court finds that any party to the proceeding or a witness therein has
intentionally given false evidence at any stage of a judicial proceeding or fabricated
false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of the proceeding, and the
Family Court is of the opinion that it is expedient in the interest of justice that an
enquiry should be made into any evidence referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of
section 195, Cr PC, 1973 it may hold a preliminary enquiry and if it thinks necessary
then it may record a finding to that effect and then proceed to make a complaint in
respect of the particular offence/offences stipulated in clause (b) of section 195, Cr
PC, 1973 to the concerned Magistrate having jurisdiction against the said person.41.
