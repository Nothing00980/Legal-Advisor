Colonial Courts of Admiralty (India) Act, 1891
Act 
No. 16 of 1891
1488.
 


Object and Reason.- The main object of this Bill is to declare certain Courts in India having unlimited civil jurisdiction to be Colonial Courts of Admiralty in pursuance of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890 (53 and 54 Vict., c. 27)
2. The Bill, like the English Act, is not intended to take-away any jurisdiction of any High Court of jurisdiction in India. On the contrary, the Bill with so far as the Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty jurisdictions of those Courts are affected, extend and improve them.
3.
 Besides the High Courts of Judicature at Calcutta, madras and Bombay, it is proposed that there shall be three other Colonial Courts of Admiralty, namely :


(a) the Court of Recorder of Rangoon;
(b) the Court of Resident ot Aden; and
(c) the District Court of Karachi
4. Under the English Act of 1890, a first appeal from the Court of the Recorder of Rangoon will lie to the Calcutta High Court; from the Court of the Resident at Aden direct to Her Majesty the Queen in Council; and from the District Court of Karachi to the Sadr Court in Sind. There is an ultimate appeal in all cases to Her Majesty the Queen in Council.
5. The Governor-General in Council has accepted the opinion of the Governor of Bombay in Council, and the unanimous opinion of the Hon'ble the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Calcutta High Court, that the jurisdiction of Colonial Courts of Admiralty in India should not be limited territorially or otherwise.
