Concealing with intent to facilitate design to wage war.
Whoever, by any act, or by any illegal omission, conceals the existence of a design to
wage war against the 46.[Government of India], intending by such concealment to
facilitate, or knowing it to be likely that such concealment will facilitate, the waging of
such war, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT—
This section reiterates the principle enunciated in section 118, the only difference being
that the penalty under it is more severe. Section 39 of Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr
PC), 1973 read with section 176 of the IPC, 1860 makes it an offence for any person
who is aware of the commission of, or of the intention of any person to commit, an
offence under sections 121–126, both inclusive (that is, offences against the State
specified in Chapter VI of the Code), to omit giving any notice or furnishing any
information to any public servant. Moreover, section 123 of IPC, 1860 makes it an
offence to conceal, whether by act or omission, the existence of a design to "wage war"
against the Government of India, when intending by such concealment to facilitate, or
knowing it to be likely that such concealing will facilitate, the waging of such war.47.
[s 123.1] Section 121 and Section 123.—
To prove an offence under section 121, IPC, 1860, the prosecution is required to prove
that the accused is guilty of waging war against the Government of India or attempts to
wage such war, or abets the waging of such war, whereas for proving the offence under
section 123, IPC, 1860 against the accused, the prosecution is required to prove that
there was a concealment by an act or by illegal omission of existence of a design to
wage war against the Government of India and he intended by such concealment to
facilitate, or he knew that such concealment will facilitate, the waging of war. In the
present case, the accused was charged under section 121, IPC, 1860, for waging war
against the Government of India or attempting to wage such war or abetting the
waging of such war. The concealment of such fact by an act or illegal omission with an
intention to facilitate, or knowing that such concealment will facilitate, waging of war,
even in the absence of proof of his involvement in waging of war against the
Government of India, will constitute an offence and an accused can always be
convicted for the concealment of such fact under section 123, IPC, 1860. The
prosecution having been successful in proving the necessary ingredients of section
123, IPC, 1860, it would constitute a minor offence of a major offence and, therefore,
the petitioner was convicted under section 123, IPC, 1860 which is a minor offence of
the offences he faced trial.48.
