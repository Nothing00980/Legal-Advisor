Culpable homicide.
Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the
intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the
knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of
culpable homicide.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or
with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z believing the
ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence
of culpable homicide.
(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or
knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires
and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence
of culpable homicide.
(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a
bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an unlawful
act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to
cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death.
Explanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring
under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death
of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death.
Explanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes
such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by
resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been
prevented.
Explanation 3.—The causing of the death of child in the mother's womb is not
homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a
living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child
may not have breathed or been completely born.
COMMENT.—
Homicide is the killing of a human being by a human being. It is either (A) lawful, or (B)
unlawful.
(A) Lawful homicide, or simple homicide, includes several cases falling under the
General Exceptions (Chapter IV).
(B) Unlawful homicide includes—
(1) Culpable homicide not amounting to murder (section 299).
(2) Murder (section 300).
(3) Rash or negligent homicide (section 304A).
(4) Suicide (sections 305, 306).
(A) Lawful or simple homicide.—This is committed where death is caused in one of the
following ways:—
1. Where death is caused by accident or misfortune, and without any criminal
intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act, in a lawful manner, by lawful
means, and with proper care and caution (section 80).
2. Where death is caused justifiably, that is to say,
(i) By a person, who is bound, or by mistake of fact in good faith believes
himself bound, by law (section 76).
(ii) By a Judge when acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or
which in good faith he believes to be, given to him by law (section 77).
(iii) By a person acting in pursuance of the judgment or order of a Court of
Justice (section 78).
(iv) By a person who is justified or who by reason of a mistake of fact, in good
faith, believes himself to be justified by law (section 79).
(v) By a person acting without any criminal intention to cause harm and in
good faith, for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person
or property (section 81).
(vi) Where death is caused in the exercise of the right of private defence of
person or property (sections 100, 103).
3. Where death is caused by a child, or a person of unsound mind, or an intoxicated
person as will come under sections 82, 83, 84 and 85.
4. Where death is caused unintentionally by an act done in good faith for the benefit
of the person killed, when—
(i) he or, if a minor or lunatic, his guardian, has expressly or impliedly
consented to such an act (sections 87, 88); or
(ii) where it is impossible for the person killed to signify his consent or where
he is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian from whom it is
possible to obtain consent, in time for the thing to be done with benefit
(section 92).
(B) Unlawful homicide.—Culpable homicide is the first kind of unlawful homicide. It is
the causing of death by doing:
(i) an act with the intention of causing death;
(ii) an act with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;
or
(iii) an act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause death.
Without one or other of those elements, an act, though it may be in its nature criminal
and may occasion death, will not amount to the offence of culpable homicide.1.
Culpable homicide may be classified in three categories—(1) in which death is caused
by the doing of an act with the intention of causing death; (2) when it is committed by
causing death with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause
death; and (3) where the death is caused by an act done with the knowledge that such
act is likely to cause death. Knowledge and intention should not be confused. Section
299 in defining first two categories does not deal with the knowledge whereas it does
in relation to the third category. It would also be relevant to bear in mind the import of
the terms "likely by such act to cause death". Herein again lies a distinction as "likely"
would mean probably and not possibly. When an intended injury is likely to cause death,
the same would mean an injury which is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to
cause death which in turn would mean that death will be the most probable result.2.
[s 299.1] Ingredients.—
The section has the following essentials:
1. Causing of death of a human being.
2. Such death must have been caused by doing an act
(i) with the intention of causing death; or
(ii) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;
or
(iii) with the knowledge that the doer is likely by such act to cause death.
The fact that the death of a human being is caused is not enough. Unless one of the
mental states mentioned in ingredient3. is present, an act causing death cannot
amount to culpable homicide.
[s 299.2] 'Causes death'.—
Death means the death of a human being (section 46). But this word does not include
the death of an unborn child (vide Explanation 3). It is immaterial if the person whose
death has been caused is not the very person whom the accused intended to kill: see
Illustration (a) and section 301.4. The offence is complete as soon as any person is
killed. Death occurs when brain dies completely. A person cannot be said dead if some
brain activity is present.5.
[s 299.3] Five-step enquiry.—
According to the Supreme Court, in case where death is alleged to have been caused
by a person, there shall be a five-step inquiry:
(i) Is there a homicide? (ii) If yes, is it a culpable homicide or a 'not culpable homicide'? (iii) If
it is a culpable homicide, is the offence one of culpable homicide amounting to murder (s.
300 of the Indian Penal Code) or is it a culpable homicide not amounting to murder (s. 304
of the Indian Penal Code)? (iv) If it is a 'not culpable homicide' then a case u/s. 304-A of the
Indian Penal Code is made out. (v) If it is not possible to identify the person who has
committed the homicide, the provisions of s. 72 of the Indian Penal Code may be invoked.6.
[s 299.4] 'By doing an act with the intention of causing death'.—
None of the endless variety of modes by which human life may be cut short before it
becomes in the course of nature extinct, is excluded. Death may be caused by
poisoning, starving, striking, drowning, and by a hundred different ways.
Under section 32, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions, and
the word "illegal" is applicable to everything which is an offence or which is prohibited
by law, or which furnishes ground for a civil action (section 43). Therefore, death
caused by illegal omission will amount to culpable homicide.7.
[s 299.5] Need for viscera report.—
Having noticed that, in several cases, where poisoning is suspected, the prosecuting
agencies are not taking steps to obtain viscera report, the Supreme Court, in Joshinder
Yadav v State of Bihar8. issued certain directions in this behalf. It was held:
We direct that in cases where poisoning is suspected, immediately after the post-
mortem, the viscera should be sent to the FSL. The prosecuting agencies should ensure
that the viscera is, in fact, sent to the FSL for examination and the FSL should ensure
that the viscera is examined immediately and report is sent to the investigating
agencies/Courts post-haste. If the viscera report is not received, the concerned Court
must ask for explanation and must summon the concerned officer of the FSL to give an
explanation as to why the viscera report is not forwarded to the investigating
agency/Court. The criminal Court must ensure that it is brought on record.
[s 299.6] Death caused by effect of words on imagination or passions.
This may sometimes require a complete study of the person of the deceased, her
psychology, nature and disposition. Going by these considerations in a case before it,
the Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the death of the young married woman
in her matrimonial home was a case of suicide and not that of murder. A letter of hers
sensing some foul play against her was neither sufficient for conviction for murder nor
to dispel the presumption of suicide generated by the type of person she was and her
mental make-up.9.
[s 299.7] 'With the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause
death'.—
The connection between the 'act' and the death caused thereby must be direct and
distinct; and though not immediate, it must not be too remote.10. Where bodily injury
sufficient to cause death is actually caused, it is immaterial to go into the question as
to whether the accused had intention to cause death or knowledge that the act will
cause death.11. In finding out whether there was the requisite intention or not, the Court
has not to go merely by the part of the body where the blow fell, but also the
circumstances and the background of the offence and also the ferocity of the attack.
[s 299.8] 'With the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death'.—
'Knowledge' is a strong word and imports a certainty and not merely a probability.12.
[s 299.9] Beating for exorcising evil spirit.—
Where the accused, in exorcising the spirit of a girl whom they believed to be
possessed, subjected her to a beating which resulted in her death, it was held that they
were guilty of culpable homicide.13.
[s 299.10] Clauses 1 and 2.—'Intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely
to cause death'.—'Knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death'.—
The practical difference between these two phrases is expressed in the punishment
provided in section 304. But the phrase 'with the knowledge that he is likely by such act
to cause death' includes all cases of rash acts by which death is caused, for rashness
imports a knowledge of the likely result of an act which the actor does in spite of the
risk.
Both the expressions "intent" and "knowledge" occurring in section 299 postulate
existence of a positive mental attitude which is of different degrees. Further, such
mental attitude towards consequences of conduct is one of intention and knowledge. If
death is caused in any of the circumstances envisaged in section 299, offence of
culpable homicide is said to have been committed.14.
[s 299.11] Distinction between knowledge and intention.—
Knowledge denotes a bare state of conscious awareness of certain facts in which the
human mind might itself remain supine or inactive whereas intention connotes a
conscious state in which mental faculties are roused into activity and summed up into
action for the deliberate purpose of being directed towards a particular and specific
end which the human mind conceives and perceives before itself. Intention need not
necessarily involve premeditation. Whether there is such an intention or not is a
question of fact.15.
[s 299.12] Death caused without 'requisite intention' or 'knowledge' not
culpable homicide.—
If the death is caused under circumstances specified in section 80, the person causing
the death will be exonerated under that section. But, if it is caused in doing an unlawful
act, the question arises whether he should be punished for causing it. The Code says
that when a person engaged in the commission of an offence causes death by pure
accident, he shall suffer only the punishment of his offence, without any addition on
account of such accidental death. See Illustration (c) to this section. The offence of
culpable homicide supposes an intention, or knowledge of likelihood of causing death.
In the absence of such intention or knowledge, the offence committed may be grievous
hurt,16. or simple hurt.17. It is only where death is attributed to an injury which the
offender did not know would endanger life or would be likely to cause death and which
in normal conditions would not do so notwithstanding death being caused, that the
offence will not be culpable homicide but grievous or simple hurt. Every such case
depends upon the existence of abnormal conditions unknown to the person who
inflicts the injury.18. A person who voluntarily inflicts injury such as to endanger life
must always, except in the most extraordinary and exceptional circumstances, be taken
to know that he is likely to cause death. If the victim is actually killed, the conviction in
such cases ought ordinarily to be of the offence of culpable homicide.19. Once it is
established that an act was a deliberate act and was not the result of accident or
rashness or negligence, it is obvious that the offence would be culpable homicide.20.
[s 299.13] Death due to diseased spleen.—
Where the accused gave a blow with a light bamboo stick, not more than an inch in
diameter, to the deceased who was suffering from diseased spleen on the region of
that organ, it was held that he was guilty of causing grievous hurt.21.
[s 299.14] CASES.—Knowledge of probable consequence of act.—Beating.—
Where a person struck with a heavy stick and killed a man, being at the time under the
bona fide belief that the object at which he struck was not a human being but
something supernatural, but through terror, having taken no steps to satisfy himself
that it was not a human being, he was held to have committed culpable homicide.22.
[s 299.15] Explanation 1.—
A person causing bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease, or
bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerating the death of that other, is deemed to have
'caused his death'. But one of the elements of the offence of culpable homicide must
be present.23.
[s 299.16] Explanation 2.—'By resorting to proper remedies death might have
been prevented'.—
This Explanation is explicit and gives no room for discussion. The reason for this
provision is obvious that it is not always that proper remedies and skilful treatment are
within the reach of a wounded man.24.
Although proof be given that the wound or other bodily injury if skilfully treated might not
have resulted in death, yet, if in fact death is the result, the wound 'causes' death. And it
does not avail the offender to prove that the first cause might have been removed or
rendered inoperative by the application of proper remedies and that death might have been
prevented. 'Proper remedies and skilful treatment' may not be within the reach of the
wounded man; or if they are at hand, he may be unable or unwilling to resort to them. But
this is immaterial so far as it relates to the due interpretation of the words 'cause of death'.
The primary cause which sets in motion some other cause,—as the severe wound which
induces gangrene or fever, and the ultimate effect, death, are sufficiently connected as
cause and effect, notwithstanding that the supervening sickness or disease might have
been cured by medical skill. All that it is essential to establish is that the death has been
caused by the bodily injury and, if there be any intervening cause, that it is connected with a
sufficient degree of probability with the primary one.25.
If death results from an injury voluntarily caused, the person who causes that injury is
deemed to have caused death although the life of the victim might have been saved if
proper medical attention had been given, and even if medical treatment was given but
was not the proper treatment, provided that it was administered in good faith by a
competent physician or surgeon.26.
[s 299.17] CASES.—
Where the deceased did not actually die from the injuries but died from the gangrene
which set in inconsequence of some dirty substance, such as a bandage or the da with
which the injuries were caused, coming into contact with one injury, although the
injuries were not the direct cause of death, the person causing the injuries was held to
have caused death.27. Where the facts were that the acts of the accused were in the
category of a rash act which brought about dashing against the victim leading to his
death. There appeared to be no intention or knowledge of bringing about a fatal
consequence. The liability was under section 304A.28.
[s 299.18] Explanation 3.—
The causing of death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide; such an offence
is punishable under section 315. But it is homicide to cause the death of a living child,
if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed
or been completely born. The former Chief Court of Punjab has observed that "if it is
not homicide to kill a child in its mother's womb, it can hardly be urged that it is
homicide to kill a child that has breathed in the womb and died while yet in the womb
and has been brought forth still-born".29.
[s 299.19] Applicability of section 299 whether conviction under section 304
Part I or Part II.—
A plain reading of section 299 will show that it contains three clauses, in two clauses it
is the intention of the offender which is relevant and is the dominant factor and in the
third clause it is the knowledge of the offender which is relevant and is the dominant
factor. Analysing section 299 as aforesaid, it becomes clear that a person commits
culpable homicide if the act by which the death is caused is done.
"(i) with the intention of causing death; or
(ii) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; or
(iii) with the knowledge that the act is likely to cause death."
If the offence is such which is covered by any one of the clauses, but does not fall
within the ambit of clauses, Firstly–Fourthly of section 300 IPC, 1860, it will not be
murder and the offender would not be liable to be convicted under section 302. In such
a case, if the offence is such which is covered by clause (i) or (ii), the offender would be
liable to be convicted under section 304 Part I IPC, 1860 as it uses the expression "if
the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of
causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death" where intention is the dominant
factor. However, if the offence is such which is covered by clause (iii), the offender
would be liable to be convicted under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860 because of the use
of the expression "if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death,
but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to
cause death" where knowledge is the dominant factor.30.
