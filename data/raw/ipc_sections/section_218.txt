Taking gift to help to recover stolen property, etc.
Whoever takes or agrees or consents to take 1 any gratification under pretence or on
account of helping any person to recover any movable property of which he shall have
been deprived by any offence punishable under this Code, shall, unless he uses all
means in his power to cause the offender to be apprehended 2 and convicted of the
offence, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
Scope.—This section is intended to apply to someone who, being in league with the
thief, receives some gratification on account of helping the owner to recover the stolen
property, without at the same time using all the means in his power to cause the thief
to be apprehended and convicted of the offence. There is nothing in this section that
should exclude an actual thief from liability under it if in addition to committing theft he
also tried to realise money by a promise to return the stolen article. An actual thief or a
person suspected to be the thief can be convicted under this section.296.
[s 215.1] Ingredients.—
This section has three essentials—
1. Taking or agreeing or consenting to take any gratification under pretence or on
account of helping any person to recover any movable property.
2. The owner of such property must have been deprived of it by an offence
punishable under the Penal Code.
3. The person taking the gratification must not have used all means in his power to
cause the offender to be apprehended and convicted of the offence.
[s 215.2] Object.—
The primary aim of this section is to punish all trafficking by which a person, knowing
that property has been obtained by crime, and knowing the criminal, makes a profit out
of the crime while screening the offender from justice. The clear meaning of the
section is that it is an offence to receive money for helping any person to recover
property stolen or misappropriated and that there is an exception only in favour of the
man who can show that he used all means in his power to cause the apprehension of
the offender.297.
1. 'Takes or agrees or consents to take'.—These words imply that the person taking the
gratification and the person giving it have agreed not only as to the object for which the
gratification is to be given, but also as to the shape or form the gratification is to
take.298.
2. 'Unless he uses all means in his power to cause the offender to be apprehended'.—
It is not for the prosecution to prove the negative that the accused did not use all his
power to cause the offender to be apprehended. It is for the defence to establish that
the accused did all in his power to cause the offender to be apprehended.299.
