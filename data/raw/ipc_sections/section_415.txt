at the time of his death.
Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use property, knowing
that such property was in the possession of a deceased person at the time of that
person's decease, and has not since been in the possession of any person legally
entitled to such possession, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine;
and if the offender at the time of such person's decease was employed by him as a
clerk or servant, the imprisonment may extend to seven years.
ILLUSTRATION
Z dies in possession of furniture and money. His servant A, before the money comes
into the possession of any person entitled to such possession, dishonestly
misappropriates it. A has committed the offence defined in this section.
COMMENT—
This section relates to a description of property peculiarly needing protection. The
offence consists in the pillaging of movable property during the interval which elapses
between the time when the possessor of the property dies, and the time when it comes
into the possession of some person or officer authorized to take charge of it.274. The
very object of this provision was to protect the property which was in possession of
deceased at the time of his death till the person(s) entitled to it step in.275.
[s 404.1] CASES.—
The circumstances namely recovery of revolver of the deceased from accused, along
with live and spent cartridges, the recovery of mobile handset of Panasonic from the
custody of the accused, and the fact that the accused was using the same soon after
the murder of the deceased with mobile phone which was registered in the name of the
accused (and that he continued to use it till his arrest), leaves no room for any doubt,
that the prosecution has brought home the charges as have been found to be
established against the accused.276. Where the accused misused the ATM card of the
deceased, it was held he had committed offence under this section.277.
