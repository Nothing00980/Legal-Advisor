Act to which a person is compelled by threats.
Except murder, and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an
offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the
time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person
will otherwise be the consequence : Provided the person doing the act did not of his
own accord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant
death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to such constraint.
Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being
beaten, joins a gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit
of this exception, on the ground of his having been compelled by his associates to do
anything that is an offence by law.
Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant
death, to do a thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take
his tools and to force the door of a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is
entitled to the benefit of this exception.
COMMENT.—
By this section a person is excused from the consequences of any act, except (1)
murder and (2) offences against the State punishable with death, done under fear of
instant death; but fear of hurt or even of grievous hurt is not a sufficient justification.
Mere menace of future death will not be sufficient.
Murder committed under a threat of instant death is not excused under this section.
But 'murder' does not include abetment of murder and such abetment will be
excused.246. Abetment of murder and of the offence of causing disappearance of the
evidence of murder was excused under this section when it was done under fear of
instant death at the hands of the murderers.247.
[s 94.1] Doctrine of compulsion and necessity.—
No one can plead the excuse of necessity or compulsion as a defence of an act
otherwise penal, except as provided in this section. No man from a fear of
consequences to himself has a right to make himself a party to committing mischief
on mankind.248.
Except where unsoundness of mind is proved or real fear of instant death is proved, the
burden of proof being on the prisoner, pressure of temptation is not an excuse for
breaking the law.249. Under the English law the defence of duress is available not only
in case of fear of instant death but also in case of serious bodily harm.250.
Furthermore, such a threat need not be always against the person of the accused.251.
This defence was not allowed to a person who voluntarily joined a criminal
organisation or gang with knowledge that the gang used loaded firearms to carry out
robberies on sub-post offices and also that the leader of the gang might bring pressure
upon him to participate in such offences. He had accordingly to participate in a robbery
under pressure in which the leader shot dead the sub-post master. His appeal against
conviction for man slaughter was rejected.252.
