Affray.
When two or more persons1, by fighting in a public place, 2 disturb the public peace,3
they are said to "commit an affray".
COMMENT—
The offence of affray in essence consists of the following ingredients—
(a) fighting by two or more persons,
(b) the fighting must take place in a public place
(c) such fighting must also result in disturbance of the public peace. Only if such
ingredients are satisfied, an offence of affray can be said to have occasioned for
which the persons causing the same would be responsible. In a prosecution
under section 159, IPC, 1860, there must be positive evidence of public peace
having been disturbed which would mean that, by the action of the accused the
even tempo of life of the public was disturbed resulting in affecting the peace
and tranquillity of the locality.217.
