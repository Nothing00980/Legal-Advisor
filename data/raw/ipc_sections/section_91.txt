Act of a child above seven years of age and under twelve of immature
understanding.
Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under
twelve, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the
nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion.
COMMENT.—
Where the accused is a child above seven years of age and under twelve, the incapacity
to commit an offence only arises when the child has not attained sufficient maturity of
understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct, and such non-
attainment would have apparently to be specially pleaded and proved, like the
incapacity of a person who, at the time of doing an act charged as an offence, was
alleged to have been of unsound mind under this section it has got to be shown that
the accused is not only under 12 but has not attained sufficient maturity of
understanding. If no evidence or circumstance is brought to the notice of the Court, it
will be presumed that the child accused intended to do what he really did. Thus, where
a child of 12 or so used a sharp sword in killing a person along with his two brothers
and no evidence either of age or immaturity of understanding was led on his behalf, it
was held that he committed an offence at least under section 326, IPC, 1860.81. The
Legislature is manifestly referring in this section to an exceptional immaturity of
intellect.82. What the section contemplates is that the child should not know the nature
and physical consequences of his conduct.83. The circumstances of a case may
disclose such a degree of malice as to justify the maxim malitia supplet octatem.84.
Where the accused, a boy over 11 years but below 12 years of age, picked up his knife
and advanced towards the deceased with a threatening gesture, saying that he would
cut him to bits, and did actually cut him, his entire action can only lead to one inference,
namely, that he did what he intended to do and that he knew all the time that a blow
inflicted with a kathi (knife) would effectuate his intention.85. In the prosecution of an
11-year-old child for throwing a brick at a police vehicle and then running away, the
Court said that the justices were not entitled to conclude from his appearance that he
was normal in respect of incurring criminal responsibility. The test is whether the child
knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong and went beyond childish mischief.
Running away was not by itself sufficient to rebut the presumption of doli incapax. A
naughty child would run away from a parent or teacher even if what he had done was
not criminal.86.
[s 83.1] CASE.—Theft by child.—
Where a child of nine years of age stole a necklace, worth Rs. 280, and immediately
afterwards sold it to the accused for five annas, the accused could be convicted of
receiving stolen property, because the act of the child in selling the necklace showed
that he had attained a sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and
consequences of his conduct on that occasion within the meaning of this section.87.
Section 83 provides that nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven
years of age and under 12, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to
judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. The IPC, 1860
provides no protection from culpable liability on ground of tender age to one who is
aged 12 years or more. In a child's life the period between seven and 12 years of age is
rather the twilight period of transition to a minimal workable level of understanding of
things in the firmament of worldly affairs. And that is why both the IPC, 1860 and the
Oaths Act have made special provisions for children below 12 years in respect of
matters dependent on a minimal power of understanding.88.
A claim of juvenility may be raised before any Court and it shall be recognised at any
stage, even after final disposal of the case.89.
