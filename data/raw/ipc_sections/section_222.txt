Public servant in judicial proceeding corruptly making report etc.
contrary to law.
Whoever, being a public servant, corruptly or maliciously makes or pronounces in any
stage of a judicial proceeding, any report, order, verdict, or decision which he knows
to be contrary to law, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This section should be read in conjunction with section 77. It contemplates some wilful
excess of authority, in other words, a guilty knowledge superadded to an illegal act.
This section and the following one deal with corrupt or malicious exercise of the power
vested in a public servant for a particular purpose. From the language of section 219
IPC, 1860, it is clear that when any public servant corruptly or maliciously makes or
pronounces in any stage of judicial proceeding any report, order, verdict or decision
which he knows to be contrary to law, shall be punished.333.
[s 219.1] Case against judicial officers.—
In the present case, there was no allegation that any of the three respondents had
passed concerned orders corruptly or maliciously or knowing that they were contrary to
law. Merely because the first order passed by the respondent No. 1 was set aside in the
revision filed by the petitioner, it cannot be inferred that respondent No. 1 had acted
corruptly or maliciously and that too knowing that it was contrary to law.334.
