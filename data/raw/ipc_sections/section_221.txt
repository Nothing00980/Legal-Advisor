Public servant framing incorrect record or writing with intent to save
person from punishment or property from forfeiture.
Whoever, being a public servant, and being as such public servant, charged with the
preparation of any record or other writing, frames that record or writing in a manner
which he knows to be incorrect, with intent to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he
will thereby cause, loss or injury to the public or to any person, or with intent thereby
to save, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby save, any person from legal
punishment, or with intent to save, or knowing that he is likely thereby to save, any
property from forfeiture or other charge to which it is liable by law, shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or
with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This section deals with intentional preparation by a public servant of a false record with
the object of saving or injuring any person or property. The correctness of the record is
of the highest importance to both the State and the public. The intention with which the
public servant does the act mentioned in the section is an essential ingredient of the
offence punishable under it.
[s 218.1] Ingredients.—
1. Accused was a public servant;
2. He was entrusted with preparation of any record or writing in his capacity as
public servant;
3. He framed the record and writing incorrectly,
4. He did it intentionally,
5. He did so with the intention or knowledge that it will—
(i) cause loss or injury to someone,
(ii) Save any person from legal punishment and,
(iii) Save from property from forfeiture or other charges.317.
In order to sustain the conviction for making an incorrect entry in a record it is not
sufficient that the entries are incorrect but it is essential that the entry should have
been made with the intention to cause injury.318.
It is not necessary that the incorrect document should be submitted to another person,
or otherwise used by the writer.
A public servant commits the offence punishable under this section even if the person
whom he intends to save from legal punishment is himself.319.
[s 218.2] Actual commission of offence not necessary.—
The actual guilt or innocence of the alleged offender is immaterial if the accused
believes him guilty and intends to screen him.320.
The Supreme Court has held that if a police-officer has made a false entry in his diary
and manipulated other records with a view to save the accused from legal punishment
that might be inflicted upon him, the mere fact that the accused was subsequently
acquitted of the offence cannot make it any the less an offence under this section.321.
[s 218.3] CASES.—
Where the accused increased the marks of particular persons for pecuniary benefits
during the course of preparing final record for appointment of physical education
teacher, it is held that the offence alleged is clearly made out.322.
[s 218.4] Public servant framing incorrect record to save any person from legal
punishment.—
A Superintendent of Police gave a warrant under the Gambling Act, 1867 to D, a Sub-
Inspector, to arrest persons found gambling in a certain house. In order to save the
persons from the legal punishment for having committed an offence under the
Gambling Act, 1867 in that house, D framed a first information and a special diary
incorrectly. It was held that he was properly charged with, and found guilty of, having
committed an offence under this section.323. A report of the commission of a dacoity
was made at a police station. The police-officer in charge of the station took down the
report which was made to him, but subsequently destroyed the report and framed
another and a false report of the commission of a totally different offence to which he
obtained the signature of the complainant, and which he endeavoured to pass off as
the original and correct report made to him by the complainant. It was held that the
police-officer was guilty of offences punishable under sections 204 and 218.324. Where
it was proved that the accused's intention in making a false report was to stave off the
discovery of the previous fraud and save himself or the actual perpetrator of that fraud
from legal punishment, it was held that he was guilty of this offence.325. Under this
section, substitution of one leaf by another so as to omit a given entry from the page
substituted is penal.326. Where a Sub-Inspector in his capacity as public servant
wrongly prepared certain notes in order to concoct a false defence for himself and his
colleagues, he was to be convicted under section 218, IPC, 1860.327. Where, however,
the main offence remains unproved the accused is entitled to have the benefit of doubt
in regard to the offence under section 218, IPC, 1860.328.
[s 218.5] Section 218 and section 192—Difference.—
The offence of section 218 IPC, 1860 is not a minor offence included within section
192. There is some resemblance between sections 192 and 218 IPC, 1860, because
both deal with the preparation of a false record. There the resemblance ceases.
Whereas in section 192 the record is prepared for use in a judicial proceeding with the
intention that an erroneous opinion be formed regarding a material point, the offence in
section 218 is the preparation of a false record by a public servant with the intention of
saving or injuring any person or property.329.
[s 218.6] Bar under section 195 Cr PC, 1973 not applicable, private complaint
can be filed.—
Section 218 is a distinct offence which can be proceeded against without the bar of
section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. There could be a private complaint in
respect of an offence under section 218 IPC, 1860.330.
[s 218.7] Sanction under section 197 Cr PC, 1973.—
Issuing false certificate by the Deputy Civil Surgeon cannot be an official act and as
such no sanction under section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is required.331.
But in a particular case332. the Calcutta High Court took an opposite view and quashed
the proceedings under section 218 IPC, 1860 holding that in the absence of sanction,
the proceeding cannot be continued.
