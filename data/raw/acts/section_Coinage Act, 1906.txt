Coinage Act, 1906
Act 
No. 3 of 1906
1486.
 


Object and Reasons.- The object of this Bill is to consolidate the Acts relating to the coinage. The law, as originally formulated in  the Indian Coinage Act, 1870 (23 of 1870), has been  materially modified by two Acts, namely, the Indian Coinage and Paper Currency Act, 1893 (8 of 1893), which  abolished obligatory free coinage, and the Indian Coinage  and Paper Currency Act, 1899 (22 of 1899), which made  gold coins a legal tender. The present Bill proposes to  repeal both these Acts as well as the main Act of 1870, to  reproduce their provisions, so far as they arc still required,  in a consolidated form, and to provide for the introduction  of a nickel one-anna piece and of a bronze-coinage.
Act 47 of 1975:-"Under Section 6 of the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, coins may be minted for issue under the  authority of the Central Government for such denominations not higher than one hundered rupees as the Central  Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette,  determine. Minting of high denomination commemorative coins has recently become a big numismatic attraction. India has been in the market of commemorative issues  from 1969. Until now, commemorative coins in the dcnomination of ten rupees, twenty rupees and fifty rupees  have been issued.
As proposals received from the World Wild Life Fund.  International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, Unismatics, Italcambio and Food and  Agriculture Organisations involve minting of coins of  higher denominations than one hundred rupees, it is considered necessary to remove the existing restriction contained in section 6 of the Act so as to enable India's participation in international commemorative issues. It is  proposed to take power to mint coins of such denominations not higher than one thousand rupees as the Central  Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette,  determine"
Act 33 of 1985:- There have been persistent re ports of shortage of coins in the country. Government have  taken various steps to meet the demand of coins. Production in the three Mints located at Bombay, Calcutta and  Hyderabad has been geared up with the purchase of new  machinery and equipment, overtime work and introduction of incentive scheme for the workers so as to ensure  significant increase in the production of coins. Although  production has increased from 525 million pieces in 1981-82 and 660 million pieces in 1983-84 to 1,063 million  pieces in 1984-86 and 1,356 million pieces during 1984-85, complaints of shortage continue. It is, therefore, proposed to import coins from foreign countries.  Necessary steps will be taken to ensure security. The  existing Act, namely, the Coinage Act, 1906 does not  specifically provide for the manufacture and import of  coins from outside the country. Hence it is proposed to  amend the Coinage Act, 1906 so as to facilitate the coining  and import of coins from outside the country.
2. This Bill seeks to achieve the above object.  - Gazette of India, 13-5-1985,  Pt. II, Section 2, Ext., P. 2 (No. 27).
