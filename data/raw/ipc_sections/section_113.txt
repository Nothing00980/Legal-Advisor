COMMENT.—
This section indicates when the right of defence of property commences and till what
period it continues. It is similar to section 102.
[s 105.1] First clause.—
The right of private defence of property commences when a reasonable apprehension
of danger to property commences. Before such apprehension commences the owner
of the property is not called upon to apply for protection to the public authorities. The
right commences not when the actual danger to the property commences but when
there is reasonable apprehension of danger.501.
[s 105.2] Second clause.—
The right of private defence of property against theft continues till (1) the offender has
affected his retreat with the property, or (2) the assistance of public authorities is
obtained, or (3) the property has been recovered.502. An offender is to be considered as
having affected his retreat when he has once got off having escaped immediate pursuit
not having been made. A recapture of the plundered property, while it is in course of
being carried away, is authorized, for the taking and retaking is one transaction. But
when the offence has been committed and the property removed, a recapture after an
interval of time by the owner or by other persons on his behalf, however justifiable,
cannot be deemed an exercise of the right of defence of property. The recovery which
the section contemplates seems to be a recovery either immediate or made before the
offender has reached his final retreat.503. Where the appellants followed up tracks
purporting to be those of their stolen cattle, and prior to the arrival of the police (for
whose assistance one of their party had ridden away) proceeded to the complainants'
village and fired at them, it was held that the appellants' right of private defence of their
property had been put an end to by the successful retreat of the thieves, and that their
alleged rediscovery of the cattle in the complainants' possession could not revive that
right.504.
[s 105.3] Third clause.—
A rightful owner in peaceful possession of his land is entitled to defend his property
against any person or persons who threaten to dispossess him. The law does not
expect any cowardice on his part when there is real and imminent danger to his
property from outside sources. Thus, a rightful owner is entitled to throw out, by using
such force as would in the circumstances of the case appear to be reasonable
necessary, any person who tries to invade his right to peaceful possession of his
properly. But if the trespasser has settled in the possession of the property, the
recourse which the rightful person must adopt. is to recover possession in accordance
with law and not by force. In such a case the trespasser would be entitled to defend his
possession even against a rightful owner if the latter tries to evict him by use of force.
But no hard and fast rule can be laid down in this behalf because much would depend
on the facts of each case.505.
[s 105.4] Fourth clause.—
In the case of criminal trespass and mischief the right of private defence ceases to
exist as soon as the commission of these offences ceases.506.
[s 105.5] Fifth clause.—
The right of private defence against house-breaking continues only so long as the
house-trespass continues; hence, where a person followed a thief and killed him in the
open, after the house-trespass had ceased, it was held that he could not plead the right
of private defence.507.
