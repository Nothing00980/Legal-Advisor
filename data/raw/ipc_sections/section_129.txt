[***]COMMENT—
Earlier the word used in section 121 was "Queen". After the formation of the republic
under the Constitution it was substituted by the expression "Government of India" by
the Adaption of Laws Order of 1950. In a republic, sovereignty vests in the people of the
country and the lawfully elected government is simply the representative and a
manifestation of the sovereign, that is, the people. Thus, the expression "Government of
India", as appearing in section 121, must be held to mean the State or interchangeably
the people of the country as the repository of the sovereignty of India which is
manifested and expressed through the elected Government.8.
[s 121.1] Waging war against Government.—
The concept of war embedded in section 121 is not to be understood in the
international law sense of inter-country war involving military operations by and
between two or more hostile countries. Section 121 is not meant to punish prisoners of
war of a belligerent nation. Apart from the legislative history of the provision and the
understanding of the expression by various High Courts during the pre-independence
days, the Illustration to section 121 itself makes it clear that "war" contemplated by
section 121 is not conventional warfare between two nations. Organising or joining an
insurrection against the Government of India is also a form of war.9.
Neither the number of persons nor the manner in which they are assembled or armed is
material to constitute an offence under this section. The true criterion is the purpose or
intention with which the gathering is assembled. The object of the gathering must be to
attain by force and violence an object of a general public nature thereby striking directly
against the Government's authority.10.
In Md Jamiluddin Nasir v State of WB,11. while enumerating what principles are to be
kept in mind in cases, involving application of sections 121, 122, 121A read with
section 120B IPC, 1860 as well as section 302 IPC, 1860, the Supreme Court, observed
inter alia that not all violent behaviour would fall within the prescription of waging war
as contemplated under sections 121, 121A, 122 read with section 120B. It was also
found that the object sought to be achieved to make a case for the application of
section 121, should be directed against the sovereignty of the State and not merely
commission of a crime, even if that happens to be of higher magnitude. The concept of
'waging war' should not be stretched too far. A balanced and realistic approach should
be maintained while construing the offence committed, to find out whether it amounts
to waging of war against the State.
1. 'Wages war'.—The expression "waging war" means and can only mean waging war in
the manner usual in war. In other words, in order to support a conviction on such a
charge it is not enough to show that the persons charged have contrived to obtain
possession of an armoury and have, when called upon to surrender it, used the rifles
and ammunition so obtained against the Government troops. It must also be shown
that the seizure of the armoury was part and parcel of a planned operation and that
their intention in resisting the troops of the Government was to overwhelm and defeat
these troops and then to go on and crush any further opposition with which they might
meet until either the leaders of the movement succeeded in obtaining the possession
of the machinery of Government or those in possession of it yielded to the demands of
their leaders.12. An illuminating discussion on the issue of "Waging war against the
Government of India" is to be found in this Court's decision in State (NCT of Delhi) v
Navjot Sandhu @ Afsan Guru.13. In para 272 of the judgment P Venkatarama Reddi, J,
speaking for the Court, referred to the report of the Indian Law Commission that
examined the draft Penal Code in 1847 and quoted the following passage from the
report:
We conceive the term 'wages war against the Government' naturally to import a person
arraying himself in defiance of the Government in like manner and by like means as a
foreign enemy would do, and it seems to us, we presume it did to the authors of the Code
that any definition of the term so unambiguous would be superfluous.
The expression, "in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy", is very
significant to understand the nature of the violent acts that would amount to waging
war. In "waging war", the intent of the foreign enemy is not only to disturb public peace
or law and order or to kill many people. A foreign enemy strikes at the sovereignty of
the State, and his conspiracy and actions are motivated by that animus.14.
[s 121.2] New concept of "Waging war" and Caution against using old
authorities.—
The concept of war in section 121 which includes insurrection or a civilian uprising
should not be understood in the sense of conventional war between two nations or
sovereign entities. The normative phenomenon of war as understood in the
international sense does not fit into the ambit and reach of section 121. In the
Parliament attack case,15. the Supreme Court held as follows:
while these are the acceptable criteria of waging war, we must dissociate ourselves from
the old English and Indian authorities to the extent that they lay down a too general test of
attainment of an object of general public nature or a political object. The Supreme Court
expressed reservations in adopting this test in its literal sense and construing it in a manner
out of tune with the present day. The court must be cautious in adopting an approach which
has the effect of bringing within the fold of S.121 all acts of lawless and violent acts
resulting in destruction of public properties, etc., and all acts of violent resistance to the
armed personnel to achieve certain political objectives. The moment it is found that the
object sought to be attained is of a general public nature or has a political hue, the offensive
violent acts targeted against the armed forces and public officials should not be branded as
acts of waging war. The expression "waging war" should not be stretched too far to hold
that all the acts of disrupting public order and peace irrespective of their magnitude and
repercussions could be reckoned as acts of waging war against the Government. A
balanced and realistic approach is called for in construing the expression "waging war"
irrespective of how it was viewed in the long past. An organised movement attended with
violence and attacks against the public officials and armed forces while agitating for the
repeal of an unpopular law or for preventing burdensome taxes were viewed as acts of
treason in the form of levying war. We doubt whether such construction is in tune with the
modern day perspectives and standards.
[s 121.3] Terrorist Acts.—
Though every terrorist act does not amount to waging war, certain terrorist acts can
also constitute the offence of waging war and there is no dichotomy between the two.
Terrorist acts can manifest themselves into acts of war. According to the learned
Senior Counsel for the State, terrorist acts prompted by an intention to strike at the
sovereign authority of the State/Government, tantamount to waging war irrespective of
the number involved or the force employed. However, the degree of animus or intent
and the magnitude of the acts done or attempted to be done would assume some
relevance in order to consider whether the terrorist acts give rise to a state of war. Yet,
the demarcating line is by no means clear, much less transparent. It is often a
difference in degree. The distinction gets thinner if a comparison is made of terrorist
acts with the acts aimed at overawing the Government by means of criminal force.
Conspiracy to commit the latter offence is covered by section 121A.16. The
incorporation of Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, shall not
be viewed as deemed repeal of section 121 of the IPC, 1860. As explained in Navjot
Sandhu (supra), a "terrorist act" and an act of "waging war against the Government of
India" may have some overlapping features, but a terrorist act may not always be an act
of waging war against the Government of India, and vice-versa. The provisions of
Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and those of Chapter VI of the
Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 including section 121, basically cover different areas.17.
[s 121.4] Foreign nationals not excluded.—
The word "whoever" is a word of broad import. Advisedly such language was used
departing from the observations made in the context of the Treason Statute. Supreme
Court finds no good reason why foreign nationals stealthily entering into Indian territory
with a view to subverting the functioning of the Government and destabilising the
society should not be held guilty of waging war within the meaning of section 121. The
section on its plain term need not be confined only to those who owe allegiance to the
established Government.18.
The explanation to the section makes it clear that the offence is complete even without
any act or illegal omission occurring in pursuance of the conspiracy.19. It is not
necessary that any act or illegal omission should have taken place in pursuance of a
conspiracy. An action of waging war, attempt to wage war or abetment to wage war are
also covered by section 121-A.20.
2. Government of India.—The expression "Government of India" is surely not used in the
narrow and restricted sense in section 121. In our considered view, the expression
"Government of India" is used in section 121 to imply the Indian State, the juristic
embodiment of the sovereignty of the country that derives its legitimacy from the
collective will and consent of its people. The use of the phrase "Government of India" to
signify the notion of sovereignty is consistent with the principles of Public International
Law, wherein sovereignty of a territorial unit is deemed to vest in the people of the
territory and exercised by a representative government.21.
3. 'Abets the waging of such war'.—Such abetment is made a special offence. It is not
essential that as a result of the abetment the war should in fact be waged. The main
purpose of the instigation should be 'the waging of war'. It should not be merely a
remote and incidental purpose but the thing principally aimed at by the instigation.
There must be active suggestion or stimulation to the use of violence.22. As criminal
acts took place pursuant to the conspiracy, the appellant, as a party to the conspiracy,
shall be deemed to have abetted the offence. In fact, he took an active part in a series
of steps taken to pursue the objective of conspiracy. The offence of abetting the
waging of war, having regard to the extraordinary facts and circumstances of this case,
justifies the imposition of capital punishment and, therefore, the judgment of the High
Court in regard to the conviction and sentence of Afzal under section 121 IPC, 1860
shall stand.23.
[s 121.5] Principles relating to Section 121.—
(i) No specific number of persons is necessary to constitute an offence under
S.121, Penal Code.
(ii) The number concerned and the manner in which they are equipped or armed is
not material.
(iii) The true criterion is quo animo did the gathering assemble?
(iv) The object of the gathering must be to attain by force and violence an object of
a general public nature, thereby striking directly against the King's authority.
(v) There is no distinction between principal and accessory and all who take part in
the unlawful act incur the same guilt.24.
[s 121.6] CASES.—Mumbai Terror Attack Case.—
The primary and the first offence that the appellant and his co-conspirators committed
was the offence of waging war against the Government of India. What matters is that
the attack was aimed at India and Indians. It was by foreign nationals. People were
killed for no other reason than they were Indians; in case of foreigners, they were killed
because their killing on Indian soil would embarrass India. The conspiracy, in
furtherance of which the attack was made, was, inter alia, to hit at India; to hit at its
financial centre; to try to give rise to communal tensions and create internal strife and
insurgency; to demand that India should withdraw from Kashmir; and to dictate its
relations with other countries. Nothing could have been more "in like manner and by
like means as a foreign enemy would do". The appellant was rightly held guilty of
waging war against the Government of India and rightly convicted under sections 121,
121A and 122 of the IPC, 1860.25.
[s 121.7] Red Fort Attack Case.—
The evidence as to the transmission of thoughts sharing the unlawful design would be
sufficient for establishing the conspiracy. Again there must have been some act in
pursuance of the agreement. The offence under section 121 of conspiring to wage a
war is proved to the hilt against the appellant, for which he has been rightly held guilty
for the offence punishable under sections 121 and 121-A, IPC, 1860.26.
[s 121.8] Parliament Attack Case.—
The single most important factor which impels to think that this is a case of waging or
attempting to wage war against the Government of India is the target of attack chosen
by the slain terrorists and conspirators and the immediate objective sought to be
achieved thereby. The battlefront selected was the Parliament House complex. The
target chosen was Parliament – a symbol of the sovereignty of the Indian republic.
Huge and powerful explosives, sophisticated arms and ammunition carried by the slain
terrorists who were to indulge in fidayeen operations with a definite purpose in view, is a
clear indicator of the grave danger in store for the inmates of the House. The planned
operations if executed, would have spelt disaster for the whole nation. The undoubted
objective and determination of the deceased terrorists was to impinge on the sovereign
authority of the nation and its Government. Even if the conspired purpose and objective
falls short of installing some other authority or entity in the place of an established
Government, it does not detract from the offence of waging war.27.
[s 121.9] Charge under Section 121, conviction under Section 123.—
In the case the Court has specifically dealt with the question whether the offence under
section 123, IPC, 1860 of which the accused was not charged, is a minor offence falling
under the charges framed, and held that the fact that there was no charge against the
accused under this particular section, does not, in any way, result in prejudice to him
because the charge of waging war and other allied offences are the subject matter of
charges. It was held that the accused is not in any way handicapped by the absence of
charge under section 123, IPC, 1860. The case which he had to meet under section 123
is no different from the case relating to the major charges which he was confronted
with. In the face of the stand he had taken and his conduct even after the attack, he
could not have pleaded reasonable excuse for not passing on the information. It was
held that viewed from any angle, the evidence on record justifies his conviction under
section 123, IPC, 1860.28.
[s 121.10] Previous Sanction.—
No Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under Chapter VI of IPC,
1860 except with the previous sanction of Central Government or of the State
Government.29. Where sanction was obtained only after cognizance, yet no prejudice
was caused because the matter was not proceeded any further and charge was also
not yet framed. The Court remitted the matter for disposal after the date of sanction.30.
