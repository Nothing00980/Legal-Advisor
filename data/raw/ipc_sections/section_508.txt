COMMENT.—
In Joseph Shine v UOI,45. a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court decriminalised
adultery and held section 497 of the IPC, 1860 unconstitutional as violative of Articles
14 and 21 of the Constitution. Under section 397 a man who had sex with a married
woman without getting her husband's permission could be charged and face
punishment with imprisonment for a term up to five years, or with fine, or with both, if
convicted. Before, it was struck down, the cognizance of the offence was limited to
adultery committed with a married woman, and the male offender alone was made
liable to punishment. Thus, under the Code, adultery was an offence committed by a
third person against a husband in respect of his wife. A married man was not liable if
had sexual intercourse with an unmarried woman, or with a widow, or even with a
married woman whose husband consented to it.
Prior to the judgment in Joseph Shine case, the Supreme Court in Sowmithri Vishnu's case46.
had upheld the constitutional validity of section 497, IPC, 1860. In Joseph Shine v UOI, AIR
2018 SC 4898 , the Supreme Court observed that: Adultery is different from an offence
committed under Section 498-A or any violation of the Protection of Women from Domestic
Violence Act, 2005 or, for that matter, the protection conceived of under Section 125 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure or Sections 306 or 304B or 494 IPC. These offences are meant
to sub-serve various other purposes relating to a matrimonial relationship and extinction of
life of a married woman during subsistence of marriage. Treating adultery an offence would
tantamount to the State entering into a real private realm. The act, i.e., adultery does not fit
into the concept of a crime. If it is treated as a crime, there would be immense intrusion into
the extreme privacy of the matrimonial sphere. It is better to be left as a ground for divorce.
For any other purpose as the Parliament has perceived or may, at any time, perceive, to treat
it as a criminal offence will offend the two facets of Article 21 of the Constitution, namely,
dignity of husband and wife, as the case may be, and the privacy attached to a relationship
between the two.
