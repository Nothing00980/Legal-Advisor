"Good faith.".
Nothing is said to be done or believed in "good faith" which is done or believed without
due care and attention.
COMMENT—
The expression "good faith" in criminal jurisprudence has a definite connotation. Its
import is totally different from saying that the person concerned has honestly believed
the truth of what is said. See the language of the law in this regard. It starts in the
negative tone excluding all except what is allowed to be within its amplitude. Insistence
sought to be achieved through the commencing words of the definition "nothing is said
to be done or believed in good faith" is that the solitary item included within the purview
of the expression "good faith" is what is done with "due care and attention". Due care
denotes the degree of reasonableness in the care sought to be exercised. In Black's
Law Dictionary, "reasonable care" is explained as "such a degree of care, precaution, or
diligence as may fairly and properly be expected or required, having regard to the
nature of the action, or of the subject matter and the circumstances surrounding the
transaction. It is such care as an ordinary prudent person would exercise under the
conditions existing at the time he is called upon to act".331. The element of honesty
which is introduced by the definition prescribed by the General Clauses Act is not
introduced by the definition of the Penal Code; and we are governed by the definition
prescribed by section 52 of that Code.332. Nothing is an offence which is done by any
person who is justified by law, or who by reason of mistake of fact and not by reason of
mistake of law, in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it.333.
Some parents made poisonous propaganda against an educational institution. The
court said that this could not have been done by them in good faith. Hence, the
exception to section 499 was not attracted. The complaint of defamation against them
could not be quashed.334.
[s 52.1] Burden of proof.—
The burden is on the accused to prove this fact. Whether a person took due care and
attention before he made the imputation is a matter most often within the personal
knowledge of that person himself. The accused must prove that he made due enquiries
before he published the imputation. It is not enough to say that he made a formal
enquiry in a slipshod manner. The words 'due care and attention' imply that the accused
must have made the enquiry in a reasonable manner with all circumspection. It is true
that the accused is not bound to prove that the enquiry made by him was fool-proof or
without the possibility of any error or chance of mistake. However, the accused must
show that he got the information from proper source and he had reasonable grounds to
believe the truth of the statement he made. The accused must prove by preponderance
of probability that there was good faith on his part. The accused also should show that
there was no malice on his part, that is to say, that there was no ill-will or spite towards
the person against whom he made the imputation. What must ultimately be decided is
the honesty of the accused in publishing the words complained of. So also the accused
are not entitled to exception 9 of section 499, IPC, 1860 merely on the reason that the
publications were not made in good faith.335.
Good faith is a question of fact to be considered and decided on the facts of each
case. Section 52 of the Penal Code emphasizes due care and attention in relation to
the good faith. In the General Clauses Act emphasis is laid on honesty.336. The
meaning of the expression "good faith" is what is done with "due care and attention".
Due care denotes the degree of reasonableness in the care sought to be exercised. So,
before a person proposes to make an imputation, he must first make an enquiry into
the factum of the imputation which he proposes to make. It is not enough that he does
just a make believe show for an enquiry. The enquiry expected of him is of such a depth
as a reasonable and prudent man would make with the genuine intention in knowing
the real truth of the imputation. If he does not do so he cannot claim that what he did
was bona fide i.e. done in good faith. Thus, a contemner, if he is to establish "good
faith" has to say that he conducted a reasonable and proper enquiry before making an
imputation.337. The question of good faith must be considered with reference to the
position of the accused and the circumstances under which he acted. 'Good faith'
requires not logical infallibility but due care and attention.338.
