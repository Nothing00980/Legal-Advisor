House trespass.
Whoever commits criminal trespass by entering into1 or remaining in any building,2
tent or vessel used as a human dwelling or any building used as a place for worship,
or as a place for the custody of property, is said to commit "house-trespass".
Explanation.—The introduction of any part of the criminal trespasser's body is entering
sufficient to constitute house-trespass.
COMMENT—
The offence of criminal trespass may be aggravated in several ways. It may be
aggravated by the way in which it is committed, and by the end for which it is
committed. When criminal trespass is committed in a dwelling house, or any building,
tent or vessel used for human dwelling, it becomes, 'house trespass' as defined under
section 442 IPC, 1860 and punishable under section 448 IPC, 1860. The offence
intended to be committed so as to constitute 'criminal trespass' is any offence. But if
such offence intended to be committed is one punishable with imprisonment and the
criminal trespass is committed in a dwelling house, then the offence which is made out
is not one punishable under section 448 IPC, 1860 but one punishable under section
451 IPC, 1860 which is an aggravated form of house trespass.673.
1. 'Entering into'.—The introduction of any part of the trespasser's body is entering
sufficient to constitute house-trespass.674. The roof being a part of a building, if any
one goes on the roof of a building that will be tantamount to "entering into" the building
within the meaning of that expression in this section.675. Section 441, IPC, 1860 would
show that it is only when a person unlawfully remains in a property of another person
"with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to
commit an offence" that an offence of criminal trespass is committed. While there may
be evidence in the present case that the accused/opposite party has unlawfully
remained in the property belonging to the petitioner or that of the Mosque Committee
to whom the petitioner is said to have donated the property, there is no evidence
whatsoever that the accused/opposite party remained there with intent to intimidate,
insult or annoy the petitioner or the Mosque Committee or with intent to commit an
offence.676.
2. 'Building'.—What is a 'building' must always be a question of degree and
circumstances; its ordinary and usual meaning is an enclosure of brick or stone work
covered in by a roof.677. The mere surrounding of an open space of ground by a wall or
fence of any kind cannot be deemed to convert the open space itself into a building,
and trespass thereon does not amount to house-trespass.678. Even a structure with a
thatched roof, doors and shutters would come within the meaning of building if it is
used as a human dwelling or place for the custody of property.679..
[s 442.1] Police Station.—
The criminal trespass in question need not be only in respect of a building used as a
human dwelling, but it also covers in building used as a place for custody of property
and as the police station is a place where there will also be custody of property, it will
also come under the definition of "Building" in section 442 IPC, 1860.680.
