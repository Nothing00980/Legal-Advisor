Fraudulent use of false weight or measure.
Whoever fraudulently uses any false weight or false measure of length or capacity, or
fraudulently uses any weight or any measure of length or capacity as a different
weight or measure from what it is, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.â€”
It is clear from the above definition that the prosecution must prove three essential
ingredients amongst others as
(1) a weight or measure is a false one,
(2) that the accused used such a weight or measure, and
(3) that he did so fraudulently.2.
