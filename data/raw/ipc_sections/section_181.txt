Refusing oath or affirmation when duly required by public servant to
make it.
Whoever refuses to bind himself by an oath 50.[or affirmation] to state the truth, when
required so to bind himself by a public servant legally competent to require that he
shall so bind himself, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which
may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or
with both.
COMMENT.—
Refusal to take oath.—The refusal to take an oath amounts to contempt of Court. The
person refusing may be dealt with under section 345 of the Cr PC, 1973 summarily or
the Court may proceed under section 195 of the same Code. The penalty of this section
would not be attracted where the refusal to take oath is justifiable. This observation of
the Supreme Court occurs in Kiran Bedi and Inder Singh v Committee of Inquiry.51. The
justification available to the police-officers in question was that they were sought to be
cross-examined under oath at the very outset of the inquiry, whereas other officers
similarly placed were to figure in the cross-examination at a subsequent stage. This
procedure was discriminatory, hence, the justification. The Court accordingly held that
the committee should not have directed a complaint to be filed against them under this
section.
