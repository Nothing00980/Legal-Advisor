Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one
who is intoxicated.
In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge
or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt
with as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been
intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without
his knowledge or against his will.
COMMENT.—
Offence requiring particular intent or knowledge.—By reading the above section, it is
clear that in the first part of the section the words 'intention or knowledge' are
mentioned, but in the latter part of the section the word 'knowledge' is only mentioned
and the word 'intention' is omitted. In case of voluntary drunkenness, knowledge is to
be presumed in the same manner as if there was no drunkenness. If really the
Parliament wanted the word 'intention' also to be presumed even in the case of an act
done in a drunken state of mind, the said word could have been mentioned in the
Second part also, but the same is omitted. Therefore, whether the accused was having
intention or not while committing an act cannot be presumed as in case of
knowledge.199. As certain guilty knowledge or intention forms part of the definition of
many offences, this section is provided to meet those cases. It says that a person
voluntarily intoxicated will be deemed to have the same knowledge as he would have
had if he had not been intoxicated. There may be cases in which a particular knowledge
is an ingredient, and there may be other cases in which a particular intent is an
ingredient, the two not being necessarily always identical. The section does not say
that the accused shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same intention as
might have been presumed if he had not been intoxicated. Therefore, although there is
a presumption so far as knowledge is concerned, there is no such presumption with
regard to intention.200. Thus, this section attributes to a drunken man the knowledge of
a sober man when judging of his action but does not give him the same intention. This
knowledge is the result of a legal fiction and constructive intention cannot invariably be
raised.201. Drunkenness makes no difference to the knowledge with which a man is
credited and if a man knew what the natural consequences of his acts were, he must
be presumed to have intended to cause them.202. But this presumption may be
rebutted by his showing that at the time he did the act, his mind was so affected by the
drink he had taken that he was incapable of forming the intention requisite for making
his act the offence charged against him.203.
So far as knowledge is concerned the Court must attribute to the intoxicated man the
same knowledge as if he was quite sober but so far as intent or intention is concerned,
the Court must gather it from the attending general circumstances of the case paying
due regard to the degree of intoxication. If the man was beside his mind altogether for
the time being, it would not be possible to fix him with the requisite intention. In other
words, where a man goes so deep into drinking that he becomes really incapable of
forming the requisite specific intent or knowledge for the offence, then in such a case
too section 86 of the Code would impute the requisite knowledge to the accused
though not the requisite intention. Thus, where the accused in a state of extreme
intoxication caused a fatal injury in the abdomen of his friend but by virtue of his highly
intoxicated state of mind was incapable of knowing then as to what he was doing far
less forming the requisite intent to kill as envisaged in section 300, IPC, 1860, he could
not be convicted under section 302 as he did not have the requisite intent to kill but he
could still be convicted under section 304 Part II, IPC, 1860, by virtue of imputed
knowledge under section 86, IPC, 1860.204. In this connection see also the discussion
under sub-head "voluntary drunkenness: when an excuse" under section 85, ante. But if
he had not gone so deep in drinking and from the facts it could be found that he knew
what he was about the Court will apply the rule that a man is presumed to intend the
natural consequences of his act or acts.205.
[s 86.1] CASES.—
Accused husband beating his wife and throwing burning lamp on her under influence of
liquor. Since he himself consumed the liquor he is not entitled to claim benefit under
section 86 of IPC, 1860.206. Act of the accused of walking a distance to the house of a
witness and concealing the weapon and his wearing apparels showed that he was
conscious and capable of understanding of his act. No evidence as regards the degree
of intoxication or any evidence of any attending general circumstances to arrive at a
conclusion that accused was beside his mind altogether temporarily at time
incident.207. On the basis of evidence in this case, it cannot be said that the accused
was so much intoxicated at the time of the incident that he was beside his mind
altogether for the time being. He did set his wife on fire, but as soon as her sari started
burning he realised the folly of his act and started extinguishing the fire. It shows that
he was not so much intoxicated that he was besides his mind altogether. Therefore, the
rule that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act can be
applied to him also. Conviction under section 302 IPC, 1860 altered to one under
section 304(1) IPC, 1860.208.
[s 86.2] Sections 85 and 86.—
The reading of sections 85 and 86 together makes it clear that section 86 is an
exception to section 85. These provisions show that if the intoxication is induced
voluntarily, the act done is an offence even if the person is incapable of knowing the
nature of the act or that what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to law. This section
obviously covers all offences. That is why; it appears that it became necessary to enact
section 86 to take care of offences requiring a particular intent or knowledge on the
part of the intoxicated offender. The section takes care of such offences and states
that if intoxication is involuntary, neither knowledge nor intention in committing the
offence will be presumed. If however, it is voluntary only knowledge of the offence on
the part of the offender will be presumed but not intention in committing it. What
section 86 means and no more as compared to section 85. The degree of intoxication
demanded by both sections, however, remains the same. In fact, it is instructive to note
that section 84 which exempts persons of unsoundness of mind also expects the
degree of unsoundness to the same extent, viz., incapability of knowing the nature of
the act or of the knowledge that what is being done either wrong or contrary to law.
Hence, the conclusion is inescapable that to avail of the exception under section 86,
the degree of intoxication of the offender must be such that he is incapable of knowing
the nature of the act or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.
Intoxication short of this degree will not entitle the offender to the benefit of the
exception.209.
