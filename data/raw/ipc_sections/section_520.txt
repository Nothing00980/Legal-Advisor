COMMENT.—
If a man intending to outrage the modesty of a woman exposes his person indecently
to her or uses obscene words intending that she should hear them or exhibits to her
obscene drawing, he commits this offence.
[s 509.1] Ingredients.—
This section requires:—
1. Intention to insult the modesty of a woman.
2. The insult must be caused
(i) by uttering any word or making any sound or gesture, or exhibiting any object
intending that such word or sound shall be heard or that the gesture or object
shall be seen by such woman, or
(ii) by intruding upon the privacy of such woman.
The burden is on the prosecution to prove that the accused had uttered the words or
made the sound or gesture and that such word, sound or gesture was intended by the
accused to be heard or seen by some woman. Normally, it is difficult to establish this
and, seldom, a woman files complaint and often the wrong doers are left unpunished
even if complaint is filed since there is no effective mechanism to monitor and follow
up such acts.45.
[s 509.2] Indecent overtures.—
Section 509 (IPC, 1860) criminalises a 'word, gesture or act intended to insult the
modesty of a woman' and in order to establish this offence it is necessary to show that
the modesty of a particular woman or a readily identifiable group of women has been
insulted by a spoken word, gesture or physical act. Clearly, this offence cannot be made
out when the complainants' grievance is with the publication of what the appellant had
stated in a written form.46.
The modesty contemplated under section 509 is to be understood as the "womanly
propriety of behaviour".47.
