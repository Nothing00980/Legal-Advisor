Title and extent of operation of the Code.
This Act shall be called the Indian Penal Code, and shall 3.[extend to the whole of
India 4.[except the State of Jammu and Kashmir].]
COMMENT—
Before 1860, the English criminal law, as modified by several Acts,5. was administered
in the Presidency towns of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. But in the mofussil, the
Courts were principally guided by the Mohammedan criminal law, the glaring defects of
which were partly removed by Regulations of the local Governments. In 1827, the
judicial system of Bombay was thoroughly revised and from that time the law which the
criminal Courts administered was set forth in a Regulation6. defining offences and
specifying punishments. But in the Bengal and Madras Presidencies the Mohammedan
criminal law was in force till the Indian Penal Code came into operation.
[s 1.1] Trial of offences under IPC, 1860.—
All offences under IPC, 1860 shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise
dealt with according to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC,
1973).7.
[s 1.2] Overlapping Offences.—
Where there is some overlapping between offences contained in IPC, 1860 and other
enactments, the Supreme Court has held that it would not mean that the offender could
not be tried under IPC, 1860. The Court concerned can pronounce on such issues on
the basis of evidence produced before it. There may be some overlapping of facts in
the cases under section 420 IPC, 1860 and section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act, 1881 but ingredients of offences are entirely different. Thus, the subsequent case
is not barred.8. A "terrorist act" and an act of "waging war against the Government of
India" may have some overlapping features, but a terrorist act may not always be an act
of waging war against the Government of India, and vice versa. The provisions of
Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 and those of Chapter VI of
the IPC, 1860 including section 121, basically cover different areas.9. The mere fact
that the offence in question was covered by the Customs Act, 1962 did not mean that it
could not be tried under IPC, 1860 if it also falls under it.10.
