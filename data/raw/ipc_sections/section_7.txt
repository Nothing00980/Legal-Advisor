Definitions in the Code to be understood subject to exceptions.
Throughout this Code every definition of an offence, every penal provision, and every
illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be understood subject to
the exceptions contained in the Chapter entitled "General Exceptions", though those
exceptions are not repeated in such definition, penal provision, or illustration.
ILLUSTRATION
(a) The sections, in this Code, which contain definitions of offences, do not express
that a child under seven years of age cannot commit such offences, but the
definitions are to be understood subject to the general exception which provides
that nothing shall be an offence which is done by a child under seven years of
age.
(b) A, a police-officer, without warrant, apprehends Z, who has committed murder.
Here A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by
law to apprehend Z and therefore the case falls within the general exception
which provides that "nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is
bound by law to do it".
COMMENT—
The "general exceptions" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of
universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in
every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the legislature
by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to
the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of the definition of every
offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lies on the
accused.1.
Section 6 is a convenient formula to avoid reproduction of lengthy exceptions in the
description of offences. In other words, all the offences must be read subject to
Chapter IV relating to General Exceptions (sections. 76–106 IPC, 1860). So when an act
falls within any one of these exceptions by virtue of section 6 of the Code, the accused
has to be given benefit of the appropriate General Exception even though it is not
specifically stated over again in the description of the offence committed.2. Section 6
of the Indian Penal Code imposes an obligation on the court to consider the case of
exceptions on its own so far as it relates to the burden of proving legal insanity under
section 106 of the Act. If the case of the accused comes within the purview of section
84 IPC, 1860, which is one of the provisions in Chapter IV of the General Exceptions of
the Indian Penal Code, the court is to give due consideration and find out as to whether
at the time of the occurrence the accused had any mental disability so as not to know
what he was doing.3.
The provisions of section 6 should be read as a proviso to section 105 of the Evidence
Act 1872.4. When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the
existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions in
the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860), or within any special exception or proviso
contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is
upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.5.
