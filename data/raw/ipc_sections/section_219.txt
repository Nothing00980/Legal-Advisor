Harbouring offender who has escaped from custody or whose
apprehension has been ordered—.
Whenever any person convicted of or charged with an offence, being in lawful custody
for that offence, escapes from such custody;
or whenever a public servant, in the exercise of the lawful powers of such public
servant, orders a certain person to be apprehended for an offence, whoever, knowing
of such escape or order for apprehension, harbours of conceals that person with the
intention of preventing him from being apprehended, shall be punished in the manner
following that is to say,—
if a capital offence;
if the offence for which the person was in custody or is ordered to be
apprehended is punishable with death, he shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be
liable to fine;
if punishable with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment.
if the offence is punishable with 300.[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment for
ten years, he shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to three years, with or without fine;
and if the offence is punishable with imprisonment which may extend to one year
and not to ten years, he shall be punished with imprisonment of the description
provided for the offence for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the
longest term of the imprisonment provided for such offence, or with fine, or with
both.
301.["Offence" in this section includes also any act or omission of which a person
is alleged to have been guilty out of 302.[India], which, if he had been guilty of it in
303.[India], would have been punishable as an offence, and for which he is, under
any law relating to extradition, 304.[***] or otherwise, liable to be apprehended or
detained in custody in 305.[India]; and every such act or omission shall, for the
purposes of this section, be deemed to be punishable as if the accused person
had been guilty of it in 306.[India].]
Exception.—This provision does not extend to the case in which the harbour or
concealment is by the husband or wife of the person to be apprehended.
COMMENT.—
To establish an offence under this section it must be shown, (1) that there has been an
order for the apprehension of a certain person as being guilty of an offence; (2)
knowledge by the accused party of that order, and (3) the harbouring or concealing by
the accused of the person with the intention of preventing him from being
apprehended.307. It would not be safe to convict the appellant for the offence
punishable under section 216 IPC, 1860 in absence of evidence in this regard.308.
This section may be compared with section 212. The latter deals with the offence of
harbouring an offender who having committed an offence absconds. This section
deals with harbouring an offender who has escaped from custody after being actually
convicted or charged with the offence, or whose apprehension has been ordered; the
latter offence is in the eye of the law more aggravated, and a heavier punishment is,
therefore, awarded for it. It is thus an aggravated form of the offence punishable under
section 212.
The section only takes into consideration cases where the man who is harboured is
wanted for an offence for which a maximum sentence of at least one year's
imprisonment is provided. No provision is made for cases where he is wanted for
offences for which the maximum sentence is less than one year.309. Where certain
persons were apprehended for gaming and they escaped from police custody, it was
held by the Supreme Court that this section was not applicable because they were
neither charged nor convicted of any offence and that the conviction should have been
under section 224.310.
