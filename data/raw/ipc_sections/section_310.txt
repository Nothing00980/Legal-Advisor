COMMENT.—
Attempt to murder.—This and the following section seem to apply to attempts to
murder, in which there has been not merely a commencement of an execution of the
purpose, but something little short of a complete execution, the consummation being
hindered by circumstances independent of the will of the author. The act or omission,
although it does not cause death, is carried to such a length as, at the time of carrying
it to that length, the offender considers sufficient to cause death.634.
The essential ingredients required to be proved in the case of an offence under section
307 are:
(i) that the death of a human being was attempted;
(ii) that such death was attempted to be caused by, or in consequence of the act of
the accused; and
(iii) that such act was done with the intention of causing death; or that it was done
with the intention of causing such bodily injury as:
(a) the accused knew to be likely to cause death; or
(b) was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or that the
accused attempted to cause death by doing an act known to him to be
so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause (a) death, or
(b) such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the accused having no
excuse for incurring the risk of causing such death or injury.635.
To justify a conviction under this section, it is not essential that bodily injury capable of
causing death should have been inflicted. Although the nature of injury actually caused
may often give considerable assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the
accused, such intention may also be deduced from other circumstances, and may even,
in some cases, be ascertained without any reference at all to actual wounds. The
section makes a distinction between an act of the accused and its result, if any. Such
an act may not be attended by any result so far as the person assaulted is concerned,
but still there may be cases in which the culprit would be liable under this section. It is
not necessary that the injury actually caused to the victim of the assault should be
sufficient under ordinary circumstances to cause the death of the person assaulted.
What the Court has to see is whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with
the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section. An
attempt in order to be criminal need not be the penultimate act. It is sufficient in law, if
there is present an intent coupled with some over act in execution thereof.636. To bring
a case within the ambit of section 307, the prosecution has to make out the facts and
circumstances envisaged by section 300. If the ingredients of section 300 are wholly
lacking, there can be no conviction under section 307.637. The ingredients of the
section are (1) intention or knowledge relating to commission of murder; and (2) the
doing of an act towards it.638. The Supreme Court held in Pulicherla Nagaraju v State of
AP that:
The intention to cause death can be gathered generally from a combination of a few or
several of the following, among other, circumstances: (i) nature of the weapon used; (ii)
whether the weapon was carried by the accused or was picked up from the spot; (iii)
whether the blow is aimed at a vital part of the body; (iv) the amount of force employed in
causing injury; (v) whether the act was in the course of sudden quarrel or sudden fight or
free for all fight; (vi) whether the incident occurs by chance or whether there was any pre-
meditation; (vii) whether there was any prior enmity or whether the deceased was a
stranger; (viii) whether there was any grave and sudden provocation, and if so, the cause for
such provocation; (ix) whether it was in the heat of passion; (x) whether the person inflicting
the injury has taken undue advantage or has acted in a cruel and unusual manner; (xi)
whether the accused dealt a single blow or several blows. The above list of circumstances
is, of course, not exhaustive and there may be several other special circumstances with
reference to individual cases which may throw light on the question of intention.639.
In a group clash, one person died and several others were injured, some of them
seriously. The accused also received injuries. Two of the accused were convicted under
section 307 and others under section 324. The Supreme Court held that, though the
injuries caused by the two accused were somewhat serious, the offence for attempt to
murder was not made out as their case stood on the same footing as that of others
and altered their conviction to one under section 324.640.
[s 307.1] Attempt.—
Attempt is an intentional preparatory action which fails in its object—which so fails
through circumstances independent of the person who seeks its accomplishment.641.
The mere use of lethal weapons is sufficient to invoke the provisions of section
307.642. There was evidence that the accused dealt with not only one blow but two
blows successively with an axe on the head of the victim. It was held that the intention
to cause death could be gathered from the circumstances.643. It is not necessary to
constitute the offence that the attack should result in an injury. An attempt is itself
sufficient if there is requisite intention. An intention to murder can be gathered from
circumstances other than the existence or nature of the injury.644.
To attract the offence the injury need not be caused to vital parts.645.
[s 307.2] Whether act committed must be capable of causing death.—
The section makes a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any.
The Court has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the
intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section. Therefore,
an accused charged under section 307 IPC, 1860 cannot be acquitted merely because
the injuries inflicted on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt.646. It is not
essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted in order
that the charge under section 307 be made out. It is enough if there is an intention
coupled with some common act in execution thereof.647. In Hari Singh,648. the Supreme
Court added that:
the intention or knowledge of the accused must be such as is necessary to constitute
murder. Without this ingredient being established there can be no offence of attempt to
murder … The intention is to be gathered from all the circumstances, and not merely from
the consequences that ensue.
The nature of the weapon used, the manner in which it is used, motive for the crime,
severity of the blow, and the part of the body where the injury is inflicted, are some of
the factors that may be taken into consideration to determine the intention.
[s 307.3] Acting in self-defence.—
The accused alleged that he was attacked by the assailant party. The plea seemed to
the Court to be true because there was no explanation from the prosecution side about
injuries sustained by the accused. The medical papers of the complainant did not
mention the name of the assailant though it was a medico-legal case. The conviction
of the accused for attempt to murder was held liable to be set aside.649.
[s 307.4] Rape on young girl.—
Where the accused took away a girl of four years to a lonely place near a canal,
sexually assaulted her and threw her in the canal, but was saved by a passer-by, his
sentence of three years RI with fine of Rs. 500 under section 307 was raised to seven
years RI and fine of Rs. 1,000.650.
[s 307.5] Simple hurt.—
Intention is an essential ingredient of the offence of attempt to murder. Where the
injuries caused were simple in nature and also not on vital parts of the body, the Court
said that the intention for attempt to murder could not be inferred. The Court held that
no offence under section 324 was made out because injuries were caused with a
sharp-cutting weapon.651. Where the accused persons had no common intention to kill
or have knowledge that death was likely to ensue but only intended to vent their ire
against their neighbour for having assaulted their bullocks, when the injuries sustained
by the injured persons were simple in nature, the Supreme Court held the accused
persons cannot be convicted under section 307 r/w 34.652.
[s 307.6] Nature of injuries is not determinative.—
The nature of injuries has been held by the Supreme Court to be not a determinative
factor. The framing of charge was challenged in this case on the ground that the
injuries inflicted on the victim were simple in nature and no injury was found on any
vital part of the body. The determinative factor is intention or knowledge and not the
nature of injury.653. The circumstances that the injury inflicted by the accused was
simple or minor will not by itself rule out application of section 307, IPC, 1860. The
determinative question is the intention or knowledge, as the case may be, and not
nature of the injury.654.
[s 307.7] Section 307 and Section 326.—
A bare perusal of these two provisions clearly reveals that while section 307 IPC, 1860
uses the words "under such circumstances", these words are conspicuously missing
from section 326 IPC, 1860. Therefore, while deciding whether the case falls under
section 307 IPC, 1860 or under section 326 IPC, 1860 the Court must necessarily
examine the circumstances in which the assault was made. Considering the fact that
the assault was made after some premeditation and pre-planning, considering the fact
that assault was carried out in the dead of the night, considering the nature of the
weapon, used, nature of the injuries caused, obviously, the present case falls under the
ambit of section 307 IPC, 1860 and not under section 326 IPC, 1860. Therefore, the
learned trial Court was certainly justified in acquitting the appellant for offence under
section 326 IPC, 1860 and in convicting him for offence under section 307 IPC,
1860.655.

victim escaped unhurt. Trial Court convicted the accused. High Court acquitted him because of
no injury. Validity of the judgment on evidence was not considered. Case relegated to HC for
