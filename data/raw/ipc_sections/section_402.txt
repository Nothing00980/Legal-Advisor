Dacoity.
When five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, or
where the whole number of persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a
robbery, and persons present and aiding such commission or attempt, amount to five
or more, every person so committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit
"dacoity".
COMMENT—
Dacoity is robbery committed by five or more persons, otherwise there is no difference
between dacoity and robbery. The gravity of the offence consists in the terror it causes
by the presence of a number of offenders. Abettors who are present and aiding when
the crime is committed are counted in the number. Section 391 IPC, 1860 explains the
offence of 'dacoity'. When five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to
commit a robbery, or where the whole number of persons conjointly committing or
attempting to commit a robbery, and persons present and aiding such commission and
attempt amount to five or more, every person so committing, attempting or aiding, is
said to commit 'dacoity'. Under section 392 IPC, 1860, the offence of 'robbery'
simpliciter is punishable with rigorous imprisonment which may extend to ten years or
14 years depending upon the facts of a given case. Section 396 IPC, 1860 brings within
its ambit a murder committed along with 'dacoity'. In terms of this provision, if any one
of the five or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits murder in
so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished with death or
imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten
years and shall also be liable to fine. On a plain reading of these provisions, it is clear
that to constitute an offence of 'dacoity', robbery essentially should be committed by
five or more persons. Similarly, to constitute an offence of 'dacoity with murder' any one
of the five or more persons should commit a murder while committing the dacoity, then
every one of such persons so committing, attempting to commit or aiding, by fiction of
law, would be deemed to have committed the offence of murder and be liable for
punishment provided under these provisions depending upon the facts and
circumstances of the case.153.
Dacoity is perhaps the only offence which the Legislature has made punishable at four
stages. When five or more persons assemble for the purpose of committing a dacoity,
each of them is punishable under section 402 merely on the ground of joining the
assembly. Another stage is that of preparation and if any one makes preparation to
commit a dacoity, he is punishable under section 399. The definition of 'dacoity' in this
section shows that the other two stages, namely, the stage of attempting to commit
and the stage of actual commission of robbery, have been treated alike, and come
within the definition.154. In other words, attempt to commit dacoity is also dacoity.
"It will, therefore, be seen that it is possible to commit the offence of dacoity under
section 395, IPC, 1860, by merely attempting to commit a robbery by five or more
persons without being successful in getting any booty whatsoever. Thus, if in a
particular case the dacoits are forced to retreat due to stiff opposition from the
inmates or villagers without collecting any booty, then it must be held that the offence
of dacoity is completed the moment the dacoits take to their heels without any
booty".155. Even in such a case all the dacoits can be convicted and punished under
section 395, IPC, 1860.156.
In a case of dacoity the circumstance that the inmates of the house, seeing the large
number of dacoits, do not offer any resistance and no force or violence is required or
used does not reduce the dacoity to theft.157.
[s 391.1] 'Conjointly'.—
This word manifestly refers to united or concerted action of the persons participating
in the transaction. It is only when their individual action can be properly referred to their
concerted action that the question of conviction under this section can arise.158. When
there is doubt as to how many persons are involved in commission of offence and the
accused/appellants were not identified during Test Identification Parade, they are
entitled to benefit of doubt.159.
[s 391.2] Five or more persons.—
Interpretation of section 391 IPC, 1860 is simple, that there must be at least five
persons in a dacoity; the section nowhere says that minimum five persons must be
convicted of it.160.
[s 391.3] CASES.—
Where the allegation was that on the day of incident, victim was travelling on scooter
with cash, two scooter borne accused armed with sword, knife, club and pistol stopped
victim, asked him to leave scooter and get away and then accused with their
accomplices fled away with scooter, accused were acquitted on the ground that test
identification parade was conducted after 46 days of arrest of alleged accused.161.
The accused persons took away gold ornaments and service revolver of the victim.
They were apprehended and, on the basis of their statements, stolen articles were
recovered. Identification of the accused persons and the articles was made by the
victim at TI parade. The conviction of the accused person was held to be proper.162.
Where there were only five named accused who committed the dacoity and out of five
two were acquitted holding that only three took part in the offence, it was held that the
remaining three could not be convicted of dacoity, as the offence of dacoity could not
be committed by less than five persons.163. Where in spite of the acquittal of a number
of persons, it is found as a fact that along with the persons convicted there were other
unidentified persons who participated in the offence, bringing the total number of
participants to five or more, it was held that the conviction of the identified persons,
though less than five, was perfectly correct.164. Recovery of articles shortly after a
dacoity at the instance of the accused persons has been held by the Supreme Court to
be sufficient for conviction under section 396 as well as under section 412.165.
