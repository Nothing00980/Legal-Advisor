COMMENT.â€”
This section provides against the negligence of common carriers by water. Where a
person, with the assistance of two others, plied a ferryboat, which was out of order and
had a crack, and he took in one hundred passengers, and consequently the boat was
upset, and seven persons were drowned, it was held that the accused had committed
an offence under this section.77. Where the lessee of a public ferry knew that boats
were usually overloaded but took no steps against it and allowed his boatmen to
overload them as they liked and in consequence, a boat sank with some passengers, it
was held that the lessee was guilty of criminal negligence and liable under this
section.78. Where a launch, which was overloaded with passengers, capsized at the
jetty owing to the onrush of persons waiting at the jetty to get on deck and the
passengers on the launch wanting to get down at the jetty, resulting in displacement of
balance of the launch, it was held that the capsizing of the launch was not because of
any negligence of the owners or the master and, therefore, their conviction under this
section could not be sustained.79. The owner who knowingly or negligently allows
overloading of his boat so as to endanger the life of the persons therein will be liable
under section 282, Penal Code.80.
There is no provision in the Code for the negligence of a common carrier by land.
