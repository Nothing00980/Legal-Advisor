Violation of condition of remission of punishment.
Whoever, having accepted any conditional remission of punishment, knowingly
violates any condition on which such remission was granted, shall be punished with
the punishment to which he was originally sentenced, if he has already suffered no
part of that punishment, and if he has suffered any part of that punishment, then with
so much of that punishment as he has not already suffered.
COMMENT.â€”
This section deals with those cases in which remission of punishment is made
conditional by Government under section 432 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Section 227 of the IPC, 1860 makes it a specific offence on the part of any person who
has accepted any conditional remission of punishment if he knowingly violates any
condition on which such remission was granted. In other words while the Code of
Criminal Procedure envisages arrest of a person who violates the conditions of
remission and remand straightway to jail, section 227 of the IPC, 1860 envisages for
the same act of violation of conditions, prosecution and the punishment, if the
prosecution succeeds, is the same, as the consequence contemplated under section
432 (3), namely, remanding of the person concerned for the rest of his term.388.
