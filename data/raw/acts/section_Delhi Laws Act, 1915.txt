Delhi Laws Act, 1915
Act 
No. 7 of 1915
1498.
 


Object and Reason.-  Owing to the issue of the proclamation cited in the preamble, adding certain territory, previously included in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. to the Province of Delhi, it has become necessary to take steps to declare the law in force in the territory now added to that province.
Save in respect of a few enactments which are referred to below, the law in force in the Province of Delhi is decalred to be in force in the territory now added to that provinces.
The enactments in force in the province of Delhi which are declared not to be in force in this territory are set forth in Schedule II.
In place of them the enactments specified in schedule III which are already in force in this area, are continued in force there. It is clearly undesirable to make any change in these laws, which mainly related to land, if such a course can be avoided.
