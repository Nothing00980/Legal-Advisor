Forfeiture of property in respect of offenders punishable with death,
transportation or imprisonment.
[Rep. by the Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Act, 1921 (XVI of 1921), sec. 4.]
COMMENTâ€”
These sections were deleted by the Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Act of 1921. They
imposed the sentence of forfeiture of property. The Court recommended reintroduction
of these sections because they have become necessary to combat the cancerous
growth of corruption. These provisions would have a determined effect on those who
are bent upon to accumulate wealth at the cost of the society by misusing their
position of power.186.
