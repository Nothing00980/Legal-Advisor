both.
COMMENT—
Unlawful assembly.—An 'assembly' is a company of persons assembled together in a
place, usually for a common purpose. Court is concerned with an 'unlawful assembly'.
Wherever five or more persons commit a crime with a common object and intent, then
each of them would be liable for commission of such offence, in terms of sections 141
and 149, Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860). It is not possible to define the
constituents or dimensions of an offence under section 149 simpliciter with regard to
dictionary meaning of the words 'unlawful assembly' or 'assembly'.2. An assembly of
five or more persons having as its common object any of the five objects enumerated
under section 1 41 of IPC is deemed to be an unlawful assembly. Membership of an
unlawful assembly is itself an offence punishable under section.143, whereas other
species of the said offence are dealt with under section 143–145 of IPC. Similarly,
sections 146–148 of IPC deals with the offence of rioting which is defined to be use of
force or violence by any member thereof. Section 149 makes every member of an
unlawful assembly liable for offence that may be committed by any member of the
unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or for
commission of any offence that the members of the assembly knew to be likely to be
committed in prosecution of the common object of the assembly.3. To bring a case
within section 149 of IPC some essential features must be present. First, there must be
an existence of an unlawful assembly within the meaning of section 141 of IPC. This is
a mixed question of fact and law.4.
The underlying principle of section 141 is that law discourages tumultuous assemblage
of men to preserve the public peace. Section 141 defines what an 'unlawful assembly'
is. Section 142 gives the connotations of 'a member of an unlawful assembly'. Section
143 punishes tumultuous assemblies as they endanger public peace. It does not
require that the purpose of the unlawful assembly should have been fulfilled.
The essence of an offence under this section is the combination of five or more
persons, united in the purpose of committing a criminal offence, and the consensus of
purpose is itself an offence distinct from the criminal offence which these persons
agree and intend to commit.5. Unlike the Indian law contained in section 141, IPC, 1860,
an unlawful assembly at common law need to have only three or more persons who
must assemble together for the common purpose of committing an offence involving
use of violence, or for achieving a lawful or unlawful object in such a manner so as to
lead to a reasonable apprehension of a breach of peace as a direct result of their
conduct.6. Thus, under section 141, IPC, especially under sub-section (3) thereof, use of
violence or likelihood of breach of the peace is not at all a sine qua non for an offence
of unlawful assembly but this is so under the common law. So under the common law,
even if the purpose of the assembly is unlawful, the offence of being an unlawful
assembly would not be committed if there is no likelihood of breach of the peace and
this would be so even if the unlawful common purpose is carried out.
[s 143.1] Ingredients.—
An 'unlawful assembly' is an assembly of five or more persons if their common object
is—
1. to overawe by criminal force
(a) the Central Government, or
(b) the State Government, or
(c) the Legislature, or
(d) any public servant in the exercise of lawful power;
2. to resist the execution of law or legal process;
3. to commit mischief, criminal trespass, or any other offence;
4. by criminal force—
(a) to take or obtain possession of any property, or
(b) to deprive any person of any incorporeal right, or
(c) to enforce any right or supposed right;
5. by criminal force to compel any person—
(a) to do what he is not legally bound to do, or
(b) to omit what he is legally entitled to do.
1. 'Five or more'.— The Constitution Bench in Mohan Singh's case7. held that it is only
where five or more persons constituted an assembly that an unlawful assembly is born,
provided, of course, the other requirements of the said section as to the common
object of the persons composing that assembly are satisfied. In other words, it is an
essential condition of an unlawful assembly that its membership must be five or more.
The Supreme Court has endorsed the view that the number of injuries caused and the
number of persons who were inflicted with those injuries, (in this case, three persons
were attacked and they sustained 13, 12 and 7 injuries respectively) can give a clue to
the fact that more than three persons must necessarily have participated in the
attack.8.
[s 143.2] Effect of acquittal of some accused:
In Mohan Singh v State of Punjab,9. the Supreme Court considered the question of
acquittal of two of the accused charged for the offence under section 302 read with
section 149, on the conviction of the remaining three accused. If five or more persons
are named in the charge as forming an unlawful assembly and the evidence adduced
by the prosecution proves that charge against all of them that is a very clear case
where section 149 could be invoked. "It is however not necessary that five or more
persons must be convicted before a charge under section 149 could be successfully
brought home to any members of the unlawful assembly. It may be that less than five
persons may be charged and convicted under section 302 read with section 149, if the
charge is that persons before the court along with others named, constituted an
unlawful assembly. Other persons so named may not be available for trial along with
their companions for the reason that they have absconded. In such a case, the fact that
less than five persons are before the court does not make section 149 inapplicable.
Therefore, in order to bring home a charge under section 149, it is not necessary that
five or more persons must necessarily be brought before the court and convicted …" In
view of the decision of the Constitution Bench in Mohan Singh's case,10. even after
acquittal of the two accused from all the charges levelled against them, if there is any
material that they were members of the unlawful assembly, the conviction under
section 302 can be based with the aid of section 149.11.
Where two of the six accused persons were acquitted without any finding that some
other known or unknown persons also were involved in the assault, the remaining four
accused persons could not be said to be members of an unlawful assembly.12. Where
a group of persons, differently armed, assaulted a man with the common object of
killing him and all the assailants accused except one were acquitted, it was held that
the remaining sole accused could not be convicted and sentenced under section 302
with the aid of section 149. The court cannot carve out a new case.13. If out of an
unlawful assembly consisting of seven named persons four are acquitted, the other
three cannot be convicted of rioting as members of an unlawful assembly.14. They may,
however, be convicted of the principal offence with the aid of section 34, IPC, 1860.15.
Where presence of eight persons in the course of assault was established, four of them
were given benefit of doubt but there was no finding anywhere to the effect that only
four persons had taken part in the assault, conviction of the remaining four on the
charge of forming unlawful assembly was not illegal.16.
2. 'Common object'.— The common object of an unlawful assembly depends firstly on
whether such object can be classified as one of those described in section 141;
secondly, such common object need not be the product of prior concert but may form
on spur of the moment, finally, nature of such common object is a question of fact to
be determined by considering the nature of arms, nature of assembly, behaviour of
members, etc.17. Mere presence in an assembly does not make a person a member of
an unlawful assembly unless it is shown that he had done something or omitted to do
something which would make him a member of the unlawful assembly or unless the
case falls under section 142.18. Thus, merely because some persons assembled, all of
them cannot be condemned 'ipso facto' as being members of that unlawful
assembly.19. At the same time it cannot be laid down as a general proposition of law
that unless an overt act is proved against a person, who is alleged to be a member of
unlawful assembly, it cannot be said that he is a member of an assembly. The only
thing required is that he should have understood that the assembly was unlawful and
was likely to commit any of the acts which fall within the purview of section 141.20.
Further the prosecution has to prove that the commission of the offence was by any
member of an unlawful assembly and such offence must have been committed in
prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or such that the members
of the assembly knew that it was likely to be committed.21. The word 'object' means the
purpose or design and, in order to make it 'common', it must be shared by all. In other
words, the object should be common to the persons, who compose the assembly, that
is to say, they should all be aware of it and concur in it. A common object may be
formed by express agreement after mutual consultation, but that is by no means
necessary. It may be formed at any stage by all or a few members of the assembly and
the other members may just join and adopt it. Once formed, it need not continue to be
the same. It may be modified or altered or abandoned at any stage.22.
Section 142 postulates that whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly
an unlawful one, intentionally joins the same would be a member thereof. Whether an
assembly is unlawful one or not, would depend on various factors, the principal
amongst them being a common object formed by the members thereof to commit an
offence specified in one or the other clauses contained in section 141.23. In a free fight
between two groups resulting in death of one person and injuries to several others on
both the sides, it was held that the formation of an unlawful assembly was not
impossible but the common object of such an assembly cannot be determined on the
basis of serious injury by one of them.24. The accused along with about six–eight
others forcibly entered into the office of a union leader and assaulted him but the victim
did not receive any serious injury inside the union office and managed to escape. Later
on in the open space some members of the crowd surrounded and attacked him and
dealt fatal blows. It was held that the accused who entered the union office did not
share the common object of committing murder of the deceased. They were convicted
under sections 326/149.25. Where the accused forming an unlawful assembly
assaulted the deceased but the injury caused by only one accused proved to be fatal
and the injuries caused by the others were found to be simple, it was held that the
common object of the unlawful assembly was only to cause grievous hurt and only the
accused who caused fatal injury was liable to be convicted for murder and others
under section 326/149.26.
The Supreme Court observed on the facts of a case that given the circumstances in
which the assembly came together and given that all parties were aware that among
them, certain members carried weapons like guns and spear, even if it was held that
common object of assembly was not to cause death, it would not be an unreasonable
inference that all accused knew that the offence of culpable homicide was likely to be
committed in prosecution of such an armed assault on another group which was not
prepared to withstand such an attack, bringing about application of second portion of
section 149. Therefore, it was held, that any of the accused found to have participated
in the assault should be held guilty under section 141 and 149.27.
[s 143.3] Determination of Common object:
Determination of the common object of an unlawful assembly or the determination of
the question whether a member of the unlawful assembly knew that the offence that
was committed was likely to be committed is essentially a question of fact that has to
be made keeping in view the nature of the assembly, the arms carried by the members
and the behaviour of the members at or near the scene and a host of similar or
connected facts and circumstances that cannot be entrapped by any attempt at an
exhaustive enumeration.28. It is difficult indeed, though not impossible, to collect direct
evidence of such knowledge. An inference may be drawn from circumstances such as
the background of the incident, the motive, the nature of the assembly, the nature of the
arms carried by the members of the assembly, their common object and the behaviour
of the members soon before, at or after the actual commission of the crime.29.
[s 143.4] Second clause—Resisting Law or Legal Process.—
Resistance to some law, or legal process, connotes some overt act, and mere words,
when there is no intention of carrying them into effect, are not sufficient to prove an
intention to resist.30. When an order is lawfully made under the provisions of a statute,
that order is law, and resistance to the execution of that law is an offence.31.
Under this clause the act resisted must be a legal act. Where a number of persons
resisted an attempt to search a house which was being made by officers, who had not
the written order investing them with the power to do so, it was held that the persons
resisting the attempted search were not guilty of this offence.32. Assembling together
for the common object of rescuing a friend from unlawful police detention has been
held by the Supreme Court as not constituting an unlawful assembly.33.
[s 143.5] Third clause.—Committing Criminal Trespass, Mischief, other
offence.—
This clause specifies only two offences, viz., mischief and criminal trespass, but the
words 'or other offence' seem to denote that all offences are included though only two
are enumerated in a haphazard way. In Manga @ Man Singh v State of Uttarakhand, the
Supreme Court while considering the application of principle of 'ejusdem generis' to
section 141 'third' clause, observed that:
We fail to appreciate as to how simply because the offences mischief or criminal trespass
are used preceding the expression "other offence" in Section 141 'third', it should be taken
that such offence would only relate to a minor offence of mischief or trespass and that the
expression "other offence" should be restricted only to that extent. As pointed out by us
above, the offence of mischief and trespass could also be as grave as that of an offence of
murder, for which the punishment of life imprisonment can be imposed as provided for
under Sections 438, 449, 450 etc. Therefore, we straight away hold that the argument of
learned senior counsel for the Appellants to import the principle of 'ejusdem generis' to
Section 141 'third', cannot be accepted.34.
[s 143.6] Suleman Bakery Case:
It is a case related to the communal riots of Mumbai in early 1993. Government
imposed curfew and the Special Operation Squad (SOS) was called to control the
communal riots on information of stone pelting, throwing of glass bottles, acid bulbs
and firing from the terrace of Suleman Bakery. It was argued that at any rate SOS was
an unlawful assembly on account of the third clause of section 141 of IPC, 1860, and
hence, all the discharged accused persons were members of the unlawful assembly
and had to be at least charged and inquired into by the courts below. It was argued that
the assembly of the police at least till the time they broke open the door was a lawful
move, as it was their duty but they should not have broken open the door and
trespassed the Suleman bakery; and all those who entered Suleman bakery formulated
an unlawful assembly as they illegally trespassed into the Suleman bakery. Since A-1,
Shri Tyagi, had ordered them to break open the doors and he was a part of that unlawful
assembly who had the common object. The Supreme Court held that they were all the
members of the SOS and had the duty to quell the riots. They were not doing anything
illegal in coming out and trying to control the riots. Court rejected the argument by
holding that a trespass becomes a criminal trespass if it is with an intention to annoy
or to do something illegal which is not the case here. There was no question of the so-
called entry amounting to criminal trespass.35.
[s 143.7] Fourth clause—Application of Criminal Force.—
The act falling within the purview of this clause is made punishable owing to the
injurious consequences which it is likely to cause to the public peace. This clause does
not take away the right of private defence of property. It does not affect clause 2 of
section 105, which allows a person to recover the property carried away by theft. It is
meant to prevent the resort to force in vindication of supposed rights. It makes a
distinction between an admitted claim or an ascertained right and a disputed claim.36.
Where five or more persons assemble for maintaining by force or show of force a right
which they bona fide believe they possess, and not for enforcing by such force or show
of force a right or supposed right of theirs, they do not constitute an unlawful
assembly.37. An assembly of five or more persons cannot be designated as an unlawful
assembly under this section if its object is to defend property by the use of force within
the limits prescribed by law.38. But when a body of men are determined to vindicate
their rights, or supposed rights, by unlawful force, and when they engage in a fight with
men who, on the other hand, are equally determined to vindicate, by unlawful force,
their rights or supposed rights, no question of self-defence arises. Neither side is trying
to protect itself, but each side is trying to get the better of the other.39.
[s 143.8] Fifth clause—Compelling persons to act or omission.—
This clause is very comprehensive and applies to all the rights a man can possess,
whether they concern the enjoyment of property or not. There is no reference to 'any
right or supposed right' as in the preceding clause.
[s 143.9] Explanation.—
An assembly which is lawful in its inception may become unlawful by the subsequent
act of its members.40. It may turn unlawful all of a sudden and without previous
concert among its members.41. But illegal acts of one or two members, not acquiesced
in by the others, do not change the character of the assembly.42. The law on the point
as stated above is approved by the Supreme Court in Moti Das.43.
[s 143.10] Being member of unlawful assembly.—
Section 142 shows that it is sufficient for the offence of riot to be proved against an
individual that the individual should remain in an unlawful assembly as soon as he is
aware that the assembly is unlawful. The word "continues" in the section means
physical presence as a member of the unlawful assembly, that is, to be physically
present in the crowd.44. This, however, should not be interpreted to mean that mere
presence as a curious onlooker or bystander at the scene of the unlawful assembly
without sharing its common object would make a person liable under section 142, IPC,
1860, for being a member of an unlawful assembly.45. Thus common object cannot be
attributed to a person from his mere presence at the scene of the occurrence. There
must be some other direct or circumstantial evidence to justify that inference.46.
For being a member of unlawful assembly it is not necessary that a person must
commit some overt act towards the commission of the crime. The test is whether he
knows of its common object and continues to keep its company due to his own free
will.47. Thus, where a large procession of Kannadigas, taken out to voice protest
against Maharashtrians, turned violent, started pelting stones and attacking police
officers; the procession turned into an unlawful assembly the moment it developed the
common object of causing damage to property and injuries to police officers.
Thereafter, every person who continued as a member of the assembly became liable
for the offence committed by the processionalists by virtue of section 149 of IPC,
1860.48. If some unidentified members of an unlawful assembly behaved in an unruly
manner, the other members in the procession cannot be held guilty of the offence by
foisting vicarious liability, merely because they were in the procession.49.
[s 143.11] CASES.—Enforcement of right by use of criminal force.—Dispute
regarding possession of land.—
Where there was a dispute of long standing between the accused and certain other
parties regarding possession of certain land, and the accused went to sow the land
with indigo, accompanied by a body of men armed with sticks who kept off the
opposite party by brandishing their weapons while the land was sowed, it was held that
they were guilty of this offence.50. Where the accused, who were in possession of the
disputed land, went upon it in a large body armed with sticks, prepared in anticipation
of a fight, and were reaping the paddy grown by them, when the complainant's party
came up and attempted to cut the same, whereupon a fight ensued and one man was
seriously wounded and died subsequently, it was held that the common object was not
to enforce a right but to maintain undisturbed the actual enjoyment of a right and that
the assembly was not therefore unlawful.51.
