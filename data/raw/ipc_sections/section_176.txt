COMMENT.—
Preventing service of summons.—This section punishes intentional prevention of the
service of summons, notice or order.
A refusal to sign a summons,7. a refusal to receive a summons8. and the throwing
down of a summons after service,9. do not constitute the offence of intentionally
preventing the service of a summons under this section. Under the Cr PC, 1973 the
mere tender of a summons is sufficient and a refusal by a person to receive it does not
expose him to the penalty of this section. Actual delivery is not necessary to complete
the service.10. Chapter X, sections 172–190 of the IPC, 1860 deal with the offences
constituting "Contempts of the Lawful authority of Public Servants". A Magistrate could
be covered by the definition of a 'Public Servant' given by section 21 of the IPC, 1860.
But the sections given in Chapter X of the IPC, 1860 relate to particular kinds of
contempt of the lawful authority of Public Servants and none of these cover the kind of
acts which were committed by the accused with the object of the stifling a
prosecution.11.
