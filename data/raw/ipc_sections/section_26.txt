STATE AMENDMENT
Rajasthan.—In section 21, after clause twelfth, add the following clause, namely:
— "Thirteenth.—Every person employed or engaged by any public body in the
conduct and supervision of any examination recognised or approved under any
law.
Explanation.—The The expression 'Public Body' includes—
(a) a University, Board of Education or other body, either established by or
under a Central or State Act or under the provisions of the Constitution of
India or constituted by the Government; and
(b) a local authority."
[Vide Rajasthan Act, 4 of 1993, sec. 2 (w.e.f. 11-2-1993)].
COMMENT—
Public Servant.—A line is drawn between the great mass of the community and certain
classes of persons in the service and pay of Government, or exercising various public
functions, who are here included in the words "public servant." There are several
offences which can only be committed by public servants and, on the other hand,
public servants in the discharge of their duties have many privileges peculiar to
themselves.51.
The test to determine whether a person is a public servant is (1) whether he is in the
service or pay of the Government and (2) whether he is entrusted with the performance
of any public duty.52. The definition is not exhaustive. A person may be a public servant
in terms of another statute.53.
Illustration.—The illustration at the end of the section relates to clause (10). The word
"Commissioner" is used in the sense of a Municipal Councillor or member and not
merely an officer designated as "Commissioner."54.
The definition of the term "public servant" cannot be extended to the provisions of the
Representation of the People Act where this Act makes reference to persons in the
service of the Government.55.
[s 21.1] Enlargement of concept under Prevention of Corruption Act 1988.—
Section 2(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 has enlarged the concept of
public servant wider than that contained in section 21 IPC, 1860. A comparison of the
definition of 'public servant' contained in section 21 of IPC, 1860 and that contained in
section 2(c) of the 1988 Act would show that section 21 of IPC, 1860 did not include
persons falling under sub-clause (ix), (x), (xi) and (xii) of section 2(c). Sub-clause (viii)
of section 2(c) is also wider in amplitude than clause (12)(a) of section 21 of IPC,
1860.56. Definition of 'public servant' is of no relevance under the PC Act 1988.57.
[s 21.2] Definition not exhaustive.—
The definition under the section has been held to be not exhaustive. A person may be a
public servant in terms of some other statute.58.
[s 21.3] Judges [clause "Third"].—
Examining the scope of clause "third", the Supreme Court has laid down in K
Veeraswami v UOI,59. that this category of public servants would include judges of the
High Courts and Supreme Court. The words "every judge", as used in the clause, the
Court said, indicates "all judges and judges of all courts". "It is a general term... and
should not be narrowly construed. It must receive comprehensive meaning. A judge of
the superior court cannot ... be excluded from the definition of "public servant". It is not
necessary that there should be master and servant relationship to constitute a person
as a "public servant". The court noted that section 21 IPC, 1860 does not define the
expression "public servant" as a concept. It enumerates only the categories of public
servants. Each category is different from the other and in some of the categories there
is hardly any relationship of master and servant. In the view of the Andhra Pradesh
High Court the Central Government is not a competent authority for sanctioning the
prosecution of a High Court Judge.60.
[s 21.4] Explanation 2.—
The person who in fact discharges the duties of the office which brings him under
some one of the descriptions of public servant, is for all the purposes of the Code
rightfully a public servant, whatever legal defect there may be in his right to hold the
office.61. But even if a person is in actual possession of the situation of a public
servant, he is not a public servant unless he has a right to hold that situation, although
in determining that right the legal defect, if any, has to be ignored.62. A public servant
under suspension does not cease to be a public servant within the meaning of this
section.63.
