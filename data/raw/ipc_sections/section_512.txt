Printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory.
Whoever prints 1 or engraves any matter, knowing or having good reason to believe
that such matter is defamatory of any person, shall be punished with simple
imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
The offence under this section is a distinct offence from the one under section 500.
The person printing or engraving defamatory matter abets the offence. This section
makes such abetment a distinct offence. Where the content of any news item carried in
a newspaper is defamatory as defined under section 499 IPC, 1860, the mere printing
of such material ' knowing or having good reason to believe that such matter is
defamatory' itself constitutes a distinct offence under section 501 IPC, 1860.182.
[s 501.1] Ingredients.—
This section requires two things:—
1. Printing or engraving any matter.
2. Knowledge or reason to believe that such matter is defamatory.
1. 'Prints'.—The publisher of a newspaper in which defamatory matter is printed is
liable under section 500. If he is also the printer of the newspaper, the case would be
covered by this section. But his liability under section 500 would in no way be
affected.183. In a case, where the Editor/owner of magazine published defamatory
statements containing imputations without due care and attention and without making
any attempt of verification before publication and the same was not published in good
faith. The court held that the charges framed against the accused under section 500,
501 and 502 read with section 34 IPC, 1860, stand proved.184.
