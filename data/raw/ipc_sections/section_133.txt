COMMENT—
Waging war against Asiatic power.—This section restrains a person from making India
the base of intrigues and enterprise for the restoration of deposed rulers or other like
purposes. The fulfilment of the obligations of the State to allies and friendly Powers
requires that the abetment of such schemes by its subjects whether by furnishing
supplies or otherwise should be forbidden.100. "One Sovereign power is bound to
respect the subjects and the rights of all other sovereign powers outside its own
territory".101. This section, however, does not affect India's right as sovereign nation to
offer political asylum to a deposed ruler.
98. Subs. by the A.O. 1950, for "Queen".
99. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, section 117 and Sch., for "transportation for life" (w.e.f. 1 January
1956).
