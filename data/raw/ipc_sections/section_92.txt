Act of a person of unsound mind.
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, 1 by
reason of unsoundness of mind, 2 is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or
that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. 3
COMMENT.—
To commit a criminal offence, mens rea is generally taken to be an essential element of
crime. It is said furiosus nulla voluntus est. In other words, a person who is suffering
from a mental disorder cannot be said to have committed a crime as he does not know
what he is doing. For committing a crime, the intention and act both are taken to be the
constituents of the crime; actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea. Every normal and sane
human being is expected to possess some degree of reason to be responsible for
his/her conduct and acts unless contrary is proved. But a person of unsound mind or a
person suffering from mental disorder cannot be said to possess this basic norm of
human behaviour.90.
[s 84.1] McNaughten Rule and the origin of Section 84 of IPC, 1860.—
Section 84 clearly gives statutory recognition to the defence of insanity as developed
by the Common Law of England in a decision of the House of Lords rendered in the
case of R v Daniel McNaughten.91. In that case, the House of Lords formulated the
famous Mc Naughten Rules on the basis of the five questions, which had been referred
to them with regard to the defence of insanity. The reference came to be made in a
case where Mc Naughten was charged with the murder by shooting of Edward
Drummond, who was the Pvt Secretary of the then Prime Minister of England Sir Robert
Peel. The accused Mc Naughten produced medical evidence to prove that, he was not,
at the time of committing the act, in a sound state of mind. He claimed that he was
suffering from an insane delusion that the Prime Minister was the only reason for all
his problems. He had also claimed that as a result of the insane delusion, he mistook
Drummond for the Prime Minister and committed his murder by shooting him. The plea
of insanity was accepted and Mc Naughten was found not guilty, on the ground of
insanity. The aforesaid verdict became the subject of debate in the House of Lords.
Therefore, it was determined to take the opinion of all the judges on the law governing
such cases. Five questions were subsequently put to the Law Lords. A comparison of
answers to question no. 2 and 3 and the provision contained in section 84 of the IPC,
1860 would clearly indicate that the section is modelled on that answers.92.
The essential elements of section 84 are as follows:
(i) The accused must, at the time of commission of the act be of unsound mind;
(ii) The unsoundness must be such as to make the accused at the time when he is
doing the act charged as offence, incapable of knowing the nature of the act or
that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law.93. Where it is proved that the
accused has committed multiple murders while suffering from mental
derangement of some sort and it is found that there is (i) absence of any motive,
(ii) absence of secrecy, (iii) want of pre-arrangement, and (iv) want of
accomplices, it would be reasonable to hold that the circumstances are
sufficient to support the inference that the accused suffered from unsoundness
of mind.94.
Though the onus of proving unsoundness of mind is on the accused,95. yet it has been
held that where during the investigation previous history of insanity is revealed, it is the
duty of an honest investigator to subject the accused to a medical examination and
place that evidence before the Court and if this is not done, it creates a serious infirmity
in the prosecution case and the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused.96.
Prosecution is duty bound to subject the accused to a medical examination
immediately.97. This onus may, however, be discharged by producing evidence as to the
conduct of the accused shortly prior to the offence and his conduct at the time or
immediately afterwards, also by evidence of his mental condition, his family history and
so forth.98. Every person is presumed to know the natural consequences of his act.
Similarly every person is also presumed to know the law. The prosecution has not to
establish these facts.99.
There are four kinds of persons who may be said to be non compos mentis (not of
sound mind): (1) an idiot; (2) one made non compos by illness; (3) a lunatic or a
madman; and (4) one who is drunk.
An idiot is one who is of non-sane memory from his birth, by a perpetual infirmity,
without lucid intervals; and those are said to be idiots who cannot count twenty, or tell
the days of the week, or who do not know their fathers or mothers, or the like. A person
made non compos men-us by illness is excused in criminal cases from such acts as
are-committed while under the influence of his disorder. A lunatic is one who is afflicted
by mental disorder only at certain periods and vicissitudes, having intervals of reason.
Madness is permanent. Lunacy and madness are spoken of as acquired insanity, and
idiocy as natural insanity.100.
[s 84.2] Legal insanity vis-a-vis Medical insanity.—
A distinction is to be made between legal insanity and medical insanity. A Court is
always concerned with legal insanity, and not with medical insanity. What sections 84,
IPC, 1860 provides is defence of legal insanity as distinguished from medical insanity.
A person is legally insane when he is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that
what he was doing was wrong or contrary to law.101. Incapacity of the person on
account of insanity must be of the nature which attracts the operation of section 84
IPC, 1860.102. An accused who seeks exoneration from liability of an act under section
84 of the IPC, 1860 is to prove legal insanity and not medical insanity. Expression
"unsoundness of mind" has not been defined in the IPC, 1860 and it has mainly been
treated as equivalent to insanity. But the term insanity carries different meaning in
different contexts and describes varying degrees of mental disorder. Every person who
is suffering from mental disease is not ipso facto exempted from criminal liability. The
mere fact that the accused is conceited, odd, irascible and his brain is not quite all
right, or that the physical and mental ailments from which he suffered had rendered his
intellect weak and affected his emotions or indulges in certain unusual acts, or had fits
of insanity at short intervals or that he was subject to epileptic fits and there was
abnormal behaviour or the behaviour is queer are not sufficient to attract the
application of section 84 of the IPC, 1860.103. The medical profession would
undoubtedly treat the accused as a mentally sick person. However, for the purposes of
claiming the benefit of the defence of insanity in law, the appellant would have to prove
that his cognitive faculties were so impaired, at the time when the crime was
committed, as not to know the nature of the act.104. Only legal insanity is contemplated
under section 84 of IPC, 1860.105.
[s 84.3] 42nd Report of Law Commission of India.—
Law Commission of India re-visited section 84 of the IPC, 1860 in view of the criticism
to the M'Naughten Rules in various countries including Britain but came to the
conclusion that law of insanity under section 84 of the IPC, 1860 needs no changes in
Indian circumstances.106.
Section 84 lays down the legal test of responsibility in cases of alleged unsoundness of
mind. There is no definition of "unsoundness of mind" in the Penal Code. The Courts
have, however, mainly treated this expression as equivalent to insanity. But the term
"insanity" itself has no precise definition. It is a term used to describe varying degrees
of mental disorder. So, every person, who is mentally diseased, is not ipso facto
exempted from criminal responsibility. A distinction is to be made between legal
insanity and medical insanity. A Court is concerned with legal insanity, and not with
medical insanity.107. In this case, the accused was under medical treatment prior to the
occurrence. Evidence indicating that he remained mentally fit for about four years after
treatment. During the trial also he was sent for treatment and his conduct was normal
thereafter. On such facts, it was held, that the accused was not entitled to protection
under section 84. The Court also added that where previous history of insanity of the
accused comes to light during investigation, the accused must be medically examined
and report placed before the Court. Any lapse in this respect would create infirmity in
the prosecution case and the accused may become entitled to benefit of doubt.
1. 'At the time of doing it'.—It must clearly be proved that at the time of the committing
of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from
disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if
he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.108. If he did know it,
he is responsible.109.
In Sheralli Wali Mohammed v State of Maharashtra,110. it was held that:
... it must be proved clearly that, at the time of the commission of the acts, the appellant, by
reason of unsoundness of mind, was incapable of either knowing the nature of the act or
that the acts were either morally wrong or contrary to law. The question to be asked is, is
there evidence to show that, at the time of the commission of the offence, he was labouring
under any such incapacity? On this question, the state of his mind before and after the
commission of the offence is relevant.
The crucial point of time for deciding whether the benefit of this section should be
given or not is the material time when the offence takes place. If at that moment a man
is found to be labouring under such a defect of reason as not to know the nature of the
act he was doing or that, even if he knew it, he did not know it was either wrong or
contrary to law then this section must be applied. In coming to that conclusion, the
relevant circumstances, like the behaviour of the accused before the commission of
the offence and his behaviour after the commission of the offence, should be taken
into consideration.111. The accused pushed a child of four years into fire resulting in his
death but there was nothing to show that there was any deliberateness or preparation
to commit the crime. His act was accompanied by manifestations of unnatural brutality
and was committed openly. He neither concealed nor ran away nor tried to avoid
detection which showed that he was not conscious of his guilt. It was held that the
accused was entitled to benefit of section 84 and his conviction under section 302 was
set aside.112. The accused, a young boy brought up by his grandfather, went abroad for
further studies. When his parents visited abroad they did not care to see him. His
grandfather's death was communicated to him much later. On return to India, he
committed offences of brutal nature at random. During the pendency of the session's
case, he again continued and completed his engineering course and started a printing
press and later he managed a garage and allied industries employing nearly 30
persons. His behaviour before and after the offences was that of a normal man. It was
held that he was insane at the time of the offence and was given benefit of section
84.113. Where the accused was examined by two doctors who certified him to be
schizophrenic and his abnormal behaviour was also apparent from the evidence on the
record, the Supreme Court held that the acquittal of the accused by the High Court was
proper.114.
In other words, to get the benefit of section 84 IPC, 1860, it must be shown that at the
time of the commission of the act the accused by reason of unsoundness of mind was
incapable of either knowing the nature of the act or that the act was either morally
wrong or contrary to law and for determining this his state of mind before and after the
commission of the offence is most relevant. It would be dangerous to admit the
defence of insanity upon arguments derived merely from the character of the crime.115.
Thus, the fact that the accused committed the murder over a trifling matter and made a
clean breast of his crime would not go to show that he was insane.116.
[s 84.4] Lucid intervals.—
A lucid interval of an insane person is not merely a cessation of the violent symptoms
of the disorder, but a restoration of the faculties of the mind sufficiently to enable the
person soundly to judge the act; but the expression does not necessarily mean
complete or perfect restoration of the mental faculties to their original condition. So, if
there is such a restoration, the person concerned can do the act with such reason,
memory and judgment as to make it a legal act; merely a cessation of the violent
symptoms of the disorder is not sufficient.117.
2. 'Unsoundness of mind.'—Whether the want of capacity is temporary or permanent,
natural or supervening, whether it arises from disease, or exists from the time of birth,
it is included in this expression. It is only 'unsoundness of mind' which naturally impairs
the cognitive faculties of the mind that can form a ground of exemption from criminal
responsibility.118. The nature and extent of the unsoundness of mind required being
such as would make the offender incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he
is doing what is wrong or contrary to law.119. Thus, as Stephen says that if a person
cuts off the head of a sleeping man because 'it would be great fun to see him looking
for it when he woke up', it would obviously be a case where the perpetrator of the act
would be incapable of knowing the physical effects of his act.120. The accused had
killed his wife and his minor children and assaulted his neighbour and the police officer.
The evidence showed that he had a history of insanity with at random assault on
strangers but his relations with his wife were cordial. It was held that the accused was
a man of unsound mind and his conviction under sections 302, 332 and 323 was set
aside.121. The accused caught hold of the legs of a girl of two years of age on the road
and struck her on the ground. She sustained head injury and died in the hospital. On the
basis of the ocular evidence about the conduct of the accused at the time of the
offence and the opinion of the doctor about his state of mind, the accused was
acquitted on the ground of insanity.122. The accused, a labourer, killed his brother's wife
and attempted to kill his mother in a quarrel over money deposited with his mother.
Accused assaulted with axe on the vital parts of the victim's body, absconded for three
months and immediately after the incident worked as a labourer in another village for
15 days. It was held that the conduct of the accused immediately before, at the time of
and after the incident, was wholly inconsistent with the plea of insanity raised by him.
The history of earlier mental derangement was not by itself sufficient to bring the case
within section 84.123. Where on the day of the crime the accused was seen dancing
with a dog on his head and with a broken bottle, but the medical evidence showed that
he was a normal man, it was held that defence of insanity was an afterthought.124. The
mere fact that the accused attempted to escape from the scene of occurrence after
killing his wife, belied his plea of insanity.125. Where a father and his relatives sacrificed
a four-year-old son to propitiate the deity, the Supreme Court held that this does not by
itself constitute insanity. Such primitive and inhuman actions must be punished
severely so as to deter others from resorting to such barbaric practices.126.
[s 84.5] Partial delusion.—
Mere abnormality of mind or partial delusion affords no protection under section 84
IPC, 1860.127. Whether a person who, under an insane delusion as to the existing facts,
commits an offence in consequence thereof, is to be, therefore, excused depends upon
the nature of the delusion. If he labours under a partial delusion only, and is not in other
respects insane, he must be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if
the facts, with respect to which the delusion exists, were real.128. If a person afflicted
with insane delusion, in respect of one or more particular subjects or persons, commits
a crime, knowing that he was acting contrary to law, but did the act complained of with
a view, under the influence of insane delusion, of redressing or revenging some
supposed grievance or injury, or of producing some public benefit, he is nevertheless
punishable according to the nature of the crime committed.129. Where the accused
after killing his daughter tried to commit suicide and there was no evidence of
psychiatric treatment but only major depression, he was held liable to be convicted.130.
3. 'Nature of the act, or...what is either wrong or contrary to law.'—If the accused were
conscious that an act was done which he ought not to do and if the act was at the
same time contrary to the law of the land, he is punishable. His liability will not be
diminished if he did the act complained of with a view under the influence of insane
delusion of redressing or revenging some supposed grievance or injury or of producing
some public benefit, if he knew that he was acting contrary to law.131. Where the
accused, a young man, took a girl of four years on a bicycle to a lonely place near a
canal, sexually assaulted her and threw her into the canal, it was held that it was a
carefully thought out action and not an act of an insane person.132.
Mere absence of motive for a crime, howsoever atrocious it may be, cannot, in the
absence of plea and proof of legal insanity, bring the case within this section.133. The
mere fact that an act of murder is committed by the accused on a sudden impulse and
there is no discoverable motive for the act will not generally afford the Court sufficient
basis for accepting the plea of insanity.134. Thus, in SW Mohammed's case the
Supreme Court held that the mere fact that no motive has been proved why the
accused murdered his wife and child or the fact that he made no attempt to run away
when the door was broken open would not indicate that he was insane or that he did
not have the necessary mens rea for the offence.135. In a Madras case, however, the
Madras High Court has held that where the accused was insane for some months prior
to occurrence and on cordial terms with his wife but suddenly killed the wife in the
open courtyard without any ostensible motive and did not even attempt to run away or
secret his crime, he had to be given the benefit of section 84, IPC, 1860.136. This case
can, of course, be distinguished from the above mentioned Supreme Court case on the
ground that in the instant case the accused had previous history of insanity which was
not fully cured. Prior or subsequent treatment for schizophrenia coupled with the
evidence of the doctor that the accused was schizophrenic would entitle the accused
to the benefit of section 84 in a charge of murder.137. But where the doctor in his
evidence merely said unsoundness of mind may have existed from before and that
evidence was contradicted by evidence of close relations about sanity of the accused
at the time of the occurrence, it was held that the accused could not get the benefit of
section 84, IPC, 1860.138. There is a difference between medical insanity and legal
insanity. By medical insanity is meant the prisoner's consciousness of the bearing of
his act on those affected by it and by legal insanity is meant the prisoner's
consciousness in relation to himself.139. There can be no legal insanity unless the
cognitive faculties of the accused are as a result of unsoundness of mind completely
impaired. In order to constitute legal insanity unsoundness of mind must be such as to
make the offender incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what
is wrong or contrary to law.140. Thus, mere abnormality of mind or partial delusion,
irresistible impulse or compulsive behaviour of a psychopath affords no protection
under section 84 of the IPC, 1860 as the law contained in that section is still squarely
based on the outdated M'Naughten Rules of 19th Century England. Thus, in
Siddheswari's case141. where the accused killed her ailing child of three and there was
also some evidence elicited in cross-examination to show that the accused had
suffered from some mental derangement two years prior to the incident, it was held
that the mere fact the murder was committed on a sudden impulse or as a "mercy
killing" was no ground to give her the benefit of section 84 IPC, 1860, even though both
euthanasia (mercy killing) and irresistible impulse would entitle the accused in England
to get the benefit of diminished responsibility and her crime would be treated as
manslaughter (i.e. culpable homicide not amounting to murder). In a latter case too the
Gauhati High Court felt that where the accused has made out a prima facie case of
irresistible impulse the plea has to be taken into consideration in deciding the question
of giving benefit of section 84, IPC, 1860, to the accused.142.
The position, however, has undergone a sea change in England where the right or
wrong test of the M'Naughten Rules no longer dominate this branch of criminal law to
the exclusion of mental abnormality falling short of complete insanity as a limited
defence establishing a claim to diminished responsibility. Thus, under section 2 of the
Homicide Act, 1957 if two Psychiatrists certify that the homicidal act of the accused
was influenced by abnormal condition of his mind though not amounting to legal
insanity within the meaning of M'Naughten Rules, still he cannot be convicted of
murder but his offence will be regarded only as a manslaughter which is equivalent to
culpable homicide not amounting to murder under the IPC, 1860. It is hoped that the
Indian law too would be changed on this score with due regard to the modern
developments in the field of psychology of criminal behaviour.
[s 84.6] CASES.—
Accused, who was a mentally challenged person before the incident, killed three
persons and caused injuries to others with an axe. He did not know the implication of
his act and indiscriminately went on wielding axe blows, be it a child or a woman and
there after he did not even attempt to hide the weapon which he used for committing
crime. He was found of unsound mind in his medical examination. Case of accused
comes within the four corners of section 84 IPC, 1860.143. Where an accused, who was
suffering from fever which caused him while suffering from its paroxysms to be
bewildered and unconscious, killed his children at being annoyed at their crying, but he
was not delirious then, and there was no evidence to show that he was not conscious
of the nature of his act, it was held that he was not entitled to protection under this
section.144. But where the accused labouring under a delusion believed his two-month-
old infant child to be a devil and danger to himself, his family and to the whole world
and, therefore, killed the child with unusual ferocity almost reducing it to a pulp and
thereafter without making any attempt to escape told the police party that he had
removed a devil from the world, it was held that the accused did not know that what he
had done was wrong and as such was entitled to get protection of section 84, IPC,
1860, even when he did not plead insanity in his defence as the prosecution itself
disclosed that he was insane.145. IPC, 1860Allegation that accused appellant had cut
his son, aged about one and a half years, to death and he was intercepted while he was
preparing to bury the dead body by digging a pit. Medical evidence shows that the
accused was suffering from schizophrenia. Accused was reticent by nature and used
to keep himself indoors and interact only when he was compelled to do so. He was not
in a normal state of mind at the time of alleged crime. Appellant is entitled to the
benefits under section 84 of IPC, 1860.146. The accused killed three persons and
caused injuries to others and there was no previous enmity or motive established. The
witnesses stated that he ran from one place to other and on his way he assaulted five
persons indiscriminately without any rhyme or reason. The evidence shows that
appellant had developed insanity since long and entitled to the benefit of this
section.147. Accused chopped off his wife's head, with a chopper. After the occurrence,
in a very unusual and abnormal manner, holding the head and the chopper in each of
his hands, he walked down the road and ultimately reached the police station. Though
this, by itself, would not be sufficient to come to any conclusion but taken along with
the other circumstances of the case would clearly point to the validity of the defence
put forward on behalf of the accused.148.
[s 84.7] Epilepsy, Epileptic fits and Section 84.—
Epilepsy usually occurs from early infancy, though it may occur at any period of life.
Individuals, who have had epileptic fits for years, do not necessarily show any mental
aberration, but quite a few of them suffer from mental deterioration. Religiosity is a
marked feature in the commencement, but the feeling is only superficial. Such patients
are peevish, impulsive and suspicious, and are easily provoked to anger on the slightest
cause. Epileptic psychosis is that which is associated with epileptic fits. This may
occur before or after the fits, or may replace them, and is known as pre- epileptic, post-
epileptic and masked or psychic phases (psychomotor epilepsy).149.
Where the accused committed the murder without any motive under the influence of an
epileptic fits, he was entitled to get the benefit under section 84, IPC, 1860.150. But if at
the time of the crime he was not acting under epileptic automatism, mere past history
of epilepsy will not absolve the accused from liability.151.
[s 84.8] Irresistible impulse.—
Mere abnormality of mind or partial delusion, irresistible impulse or compulsive
behaviour of a psychopath affords no protection under section 84 as the law contained
in that section is still squarely based on the outdated M'Naughten Rules of 19th
Century. The provisions of section 84 are in substance the same as those laid down in
the answers of the Judges to the questions put to them by the House of Lords, in
M'Naughten's case. Behaviour, antecedent, attendant and subsequent to the event, may
be relevant in finding the mental condition of the accused at the time of the event, but
not that remote in time.152.
[s 84.9] Nervousness.—
The fact that the accused became nervous after raping a six-year-old girl and in that
state of mind killed her, was held to be not sufficient to establish insanity. The Court
reduced the death sentence to life imprisonment and added that nervous psychosis
may become in circumstances a kind of insanity.153.
[s 84.10] Homicide by ' ganja ' smoker.—
In a case of ganja addict before the Supreme Court, the accused had killed his wife and
children ranging one –16 years with knife. Death sentence was confirmed by the High
Court. The accused had not raised the defence of unsoundness in Courts below. The
Supreme Court got the enquiry conducted by police after a plea was raised at the SLP
stage. The enquiry report and evidence of family members and other witnesses
revealed the addiction and on-going treatment. He was not allowed the benefit of
section 84. The state of mind on the day of the incident is the crucial factor. The State
of mind on other days is relevant only if such evidence would help determining the
state of mind at the crucial moment.154.
[s 84.11] Insane delusion.—
The accused killed two women by cutting their necks with an axe without any reason.
Evidence showed that he suffered from similar attacks of disorder earlier too. After the
incident he was heard saying that he was haunted by a God to do what he did. The plea
of insanity was accepted and the accused was directed to be kept in a mental
hospital.155. The accused killed seven persons including his wife and two children with
an axe. He also killed the cattle which came his way. There was no provocation. It was
brutality simpliciter. The evidence on record showed that he was not of sound mind.
The death sentence awarded to him was set aside. He was acquitted under the benefit
of this section.156. Mere abnormality or partial delusion, irresistible impulse or
compulsive behaviour of a psychopath affords no protection under section 84 of the
Penal Code.157.
[s 84.12] Paranoid schizophrenia.—
Paranoid schizophrenia, in the vast majority of cases, starts in the fourth decade and
develops insidiously. Suspiciousness is the characteristic symptom of the early stage.
Ideas of reference occur, which gradually develop into delusions of persecution.
Auditory hallucinations follow which in the beginning, start as sounds or noises in the
ears, but afterwards change into abuses or insults.158. In paranoid schizophrenia, the
person affected lives in a state of constant fear being haunted by the belief that he is
being poisoned, some noxious gases are blown into his room and that all are plotting
against him to ruin him. The patient gets very irritated and excited owing to equally
painful and disagreeable hallucinations and delusions.159. The accused was convicted
for having murdered his wife in a brutal manner. He raised the plea of insanity. It came
out from evidence that he was suffering from leprosy and insanity from sometime past.
The medical opinion was that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia which is a
form of paranoid psychosis. The plea was allowed. But he being not in a fit state of
mind to judge his own welfare or take care of himself without medical aid, the Court
directed him to be detained in safe custody under medical supervision and not to be
released till medical evidence of social fitness.160. The evidence on record shows that
on the day of the incident, when the appellant was examined by doctors, he was found
to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. He had delusions and persecutory ideas
with no insight in his illness. From this, an inference can reasonably be drawn that the
accused was under paranoid delusions at the time that he committed the offence.161.
[s 84.13] Burden of proof.—
The Supreme Court defined the doctrine of burden of proof in the context of the plea of
insanity in the following propositions:-
"(1) The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had
committed the offence with the requisite mens rea; and the burden of proving
that always rests on the prosecution from the beginning to the end of the trial.
(2) There is a rebuttable presumption that the appellant was not insane, when he
committed the crime, in the sense laid down by section 84 of the IPC, 1860: the
appellant may rebut it by placing before the court all the relevant evidence - oral,
documentary or circumstantial, but the burden of proof upon him is no higher
than that rests upon a party to civil proceedings.
(3) Even if the appellant was not able to establish conclusively that he was insane
at the time he committed the offence, the evidence placed before the court by
the appellant or by the prosecution may raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of
the court as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence, including
mens rea of the appellant and in that case the court would be entitled to acquit
the appellant on the ground that the general burden of proof resting on the
prosecution was not discharged".162.
It has been held that merely because an injured witness, who may legitimately be
classified as an interested witness for obvious reasons, may have stated that the
appellant was not of unsound mind, cannot absolve the primary duty of the prosecution
to establish its case beyond all reasonable doubt explaining why the plea for
unsoundness of mind taken by the accused was untenable.163.
The burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the
purview of section 84 lies upon the accused under section 105 of the Indian Evidence
Act. Under the said section, the Court shall presume the absence of such
circumstances.164. But the burden on the accused cannot be equivalent with the
burden of proof on the prosecution and cannot be rated higher than the burden on a
party to a civil proceeding where a finding can be based upon preponderance of
probabilities. There is no conflict between the general burden which is always on the
prosecution and which never shifts and the special burden which rests on the accused
to make out the defence of insanity.165. Sometimes the facts may in themselves be
sufficient to discharge the burden which lies on the accused. This possibility was
recognised by the Supreme Court in Ratan Lal v State of MP.166. The accused-appellant
was kept in police custody for ten days and only then it was felt that he needed medical
examination. There was no evidence on record to show what his condition was during
those ten days and why he was not examined earlier. This conduct on the part of the
police, neither to arrange his examination nor permit him to do so, brought about such
a gap of time between the incident and examination that his condition at the time of
the incident was no longer capable of being precisely determined. As against this
police inaction, the defence pointed towards the conduct of the accused before the
incident and some statements of witnesses which supported the instable condition of
the accused. This was held to be sufficient to discharge the burden which lies on the
accused and his acquittal was upheld by the Supreme Court. Going by this case in
Tukappa Tamanna Lingardi v State of Maharashtra,167. the Bombay High Court found
evidence of insanity from a narration of the facts themselves. Mere oral statements of
witnesses cannot give rise to an inference that the appellant was of unsound mind at
the time of commission of offence. Plea of the accused does not come within
exception contemplated under section 84 of IPC, 1860.168. IPC, 1860
Where there was no satisfactory evidence of the previous history of the accused or his
subsequent conduct and the only fact on record was that ghastly murders were
committed without motive, it was held that the burden of proof as to plea of insanity
was not discharged. However, because of the absence of motive, premeditation and
any weapon, killings being done with stone pieces, death sentence was converted into
life imprisonment.169. Where, on the other hand, a father killed his son and then danced
around, moving towards his house threatening others, facts spoke for themselves so
as to discharge the burden of proof as to insanity, the accused was acquitted and
ordered to be detained in a mental home.170.
Mere eccentric behaviour, like drowning one's own two and a half-year-old child to
death, does not discharge this burden which is essentially on the accused and requires
him to show all the ingredients of the defence to the extent at least of making them
probable at the time of the commission of the act. Previous history and subsequent
conduct are only relevant facts in the determination of the condition at the material
time.171.
The mere absence of motive is not sufficient to bring the case within the scope of
section 84.172.
[s 84.14] Sentencing.—
The accused was charged with offences under sections 427, 302, 307, 451, etc.
Medical evidence showed that he was a person of unsound mind at the time when the
offences were committed. The accused, therefore, could not be detained in prison. He
was directed to be put in a mental hospital. The authorities were further directed to
follow the procedure prescribed by section 335, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr
PC, 1973).173.
[s 84.15] Sentencing.—Battered woman syndrome.—
The accused woman pleaded guilty to manslaughter on an indictment for murder. She
was a young woman aged 20. She began a sexual relationship with the deceased when
she was 14 and began to live with him when she was 16. She had a miscarriage and on
two occasions took overdoses. The deceased became violent towards her two or three
times each week. She sought psychiatric help and on two occasions came to the
attention of the police. In 1998 she decided to end the relationship and there was an
argument which developed into a fight. She picked up a knife and waved it at the
deceased, telling him to leave. There was a further struggle during the course of which
the deceased received a fatal knife wound to his back. She immediately shouted for
help and was found in an extremely distressed condition. When she was examined, she
was found to be extensively bruised. A psychiatrist who examined her found that she
exhibited a number of features of the "battered woman's syndrome", including chronic
depressive illness, a feeling of hopelessness and despair, and inability to act effectively
or to see an escape from her situation, and feelings of self-blame, shame and a poor
sense of self-worth. A second psychiatrist found a degree of clinical depression which
amounted to abnormality of mind. She was sentenced to four years' detention in a
young offender institution. Her appeal against the sentence was allowed. In the light of
the evidence, the Court reached the conclusion that there were in the present case
those exceptional circumstances which would allow the Court to take the unusual
course of passing a sentence other than custody. The accused woman had been
subject from a young age to persistent and prolonged violence from a man older than
herself who was domineering and demanding. Since her arrest she had made
remarkable progress, and a custodial sentence would be likely to damage and possibly
bring to an end that rehabilitation. She had served the equivalent of a sentence of 12
months and it was appropriate to give her the opportunity to continue her progress. The
Court accordingly quashed the sentence of four years' detention in a young offender
institution and substituted a probation order.174.
[s 84.16] CASES.—Defence not made out.—
Accused came to the house one day prior to the occurrence, demanded money and
threatened the deceased of grave consequences and on the next day, when the
demand was not fulfilled, he trespassed into the house, pushed away PWs 1 and 2,
bolted the door from inside and inflicted repeated aruval blows on the deceased that
resulted into her death. All these aspects also show that at the relevant time, he was
not insane as claimed by him.175. Accused committed murder of two persons
andcaused injuries to another. Testimony of witnesses was found cogent and reliable
and there was no material on the basis of which it could be inferred that at the time of
commission of offence the accused was of unsound mind to such an extent that by
reason of such unsoundness, he was incapable of knowing the nature of the act or
knowing that he was doing what was either wrong or contrary to law, plea of insanity
rejected.176. Mere taking treatment earlier in Mental Hospital itself is not sufficient
proof of total insanity of person.177.
The accused killed his wife and daughter with an axe. He attended Kirtan (rendering of
religious hymns) a night before. He carried the corpses in a hand-cart and made his
statement before the police. His confessional statement was recorded by a competent
judicial magistrate. He found no noticeable abnormality of mind or mental
disorderliness. Even on his examination under section 313, Cr PC, 1973, he showed a
soundness of mind. It was held that he was not entitled to the benefit of section 84.178.
[s 84.17] When to be pleaded.—
The plea cannot be raised for the first time before the Supreme Court for which no
foundation was established before.179.
[s 84.18] Investigation of offence vis-à-vis the general exceptions–
The duty cast upon the investigating officer to investigate into the mental condition of
the accused is very important. The Supreme Court held that, where during the
investigation previous history of insanity is revealed, it is the duty of an honest
investigator to subject the accused to a medical examination and place that evidence
before the Court and if this is not done, it creates a serious infirmity in the prosecution
case and the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused.180. The Division Bench of
High Court of Kerala observed that even if all the acts constituting an offence as per
definition in IPC, 1860 are committed by a person, if an investigating officer finds on
investigation that by reason of unsoundness of mind, accused was incapable of
knowing the nature of the act, or that he was doing what is either wrong or contrary to
law, as stated in Section 84 IPC, 1860, he shall not file a charge sheet against such
person.181. The Court also held that the investigating officer is bound to investigate
and confirm that despite what is contained in the "General Exceptions", acts committed
by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860.182. But the Single Bench of the
High Court of Kerala, later, held that the ingredients of section 84 can only be taken as
a defence during trial and it is not possible to throw out the Final Report in a case on
the ground that the concerned accused was suffering from legal insanity.183.
