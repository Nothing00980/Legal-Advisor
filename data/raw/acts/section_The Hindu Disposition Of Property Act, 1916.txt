The Hindu Disposition Of Property Act, 1916
(15 of 1916)

Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The object of the Bill is to enable Hindus and Mussalmans to dispose of property by transfer inter vivos and by Will for the benefit of unborn persons within certain limits. According to the Hindu Law, as now administered in British India, a gift in favour of a person not in existence at the date of the gift is void; and so also a bequest in favour of a person not in existence at the time of the testator's death. The same is the rule of Mohammedan Law, except that, under the provisions of the Mussalmans Wakf Validating Act, 1913, it is competent to a Mohammedan to settle property for the benefit of unborn persons even in perpetuity, provided the ultimate disposition is for the benefit of charity.
Every lawyer familiar with the Indian Courts must have come across a large number of settlements and Wills made by Hindus and Muhammadans for the benefit of their children and grand-children. The paramount object of the settlor in all these cases has been to provide not only for his children and grand-children then in existence, but also for those to be born hereafter, instead, however, of giving effect to the settlor's intention, the law as now administered completely defeats it. Even where a donor has only one child in existence at the date of the gift, and the gift is made in express terms for the benefit of all his children including those to be born hereafter, the law excludes from the benefit of the gift all children born subsequently to the date of the gift, to the entire subversion of the donor's intention. Similarly, the intention of testators to benefit by their Wills their children and grand-children not in existence at the death of the testators is also defeated. It is to remedy these evils, and to give effect to the settlor's or testator's intention, that the present Bill is proposed. The sole object of the Bill is to enable the Court to carry out settlor's or testator's intention, which, under the present state of the law, they are precluded from it. At the same time, it is recognised that this can only be done within the limits allowed by the rule against perpetuity, and these limits are prescribed in clauses 4 and 5. The effect of this Bill, if passed into law, will be to enable Hindus and Mohammedans to make dispositions of their property to the same extent, and subject to the same limitations as other communities in British India.
