Abduction.
Whoever by force compels, or by any deceitful means induces, any person to go from
any place, is said to abduct that person.
COMMENT.—
This section merely gives a definition of the word "abduction" which occurs in some of
the penal provisions which follow. There is no such offence as abduction under the
Code, but abduction with certain intent is an offence. Force or fraud is essential.
[s 362.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires two things:—
(1) Forceful compulsion or inducement by deceitful means.1077.
(2) The object of such compulsion or inducement must be the going of a person
from any place.
"The expression "deceitful means" includes a misleading statement. It is, really
speaking, a matter of intention. The intention of the accused is the basis and gravamen
of the charge. The volition, the intention and conduct of the woman do not determine
the offence.1078. The offence of abduction under section 362 of the Code involves use
of force or deceit to compel or induce any person to go from any place.1079.
[s 362.2] Abduction and kidnapping.—
(1) 'Kidnapping' is committed only in respect of a minor under 16 years of age if a male,
and under 18 years if a female or a person of unsound mind; 'abduction', in respect of a
person of any age.
(2) In 'kidnapping', the person kidnapped is removed out of lawful guardianship. A child
without a guardian cannot be kidnapped. 'Abduction' has reference exclusively to the
person abducted.
(3) In 'kidnapping', the minor is simply taken away. The means used may be innocent. In
'abduction', force, compulsion, or deceitful means are used.
(4) In kidnapping, consent of the person taken or enticed is immaterial; in abduction,
consent of the person moved, if freely and voluntarily given, condones abduction.
(5) In kidnapping, the intent of the offender is a wholly irrelevant consideration: in
abduction, it is the all-important factor.
(6) Kidnapping from guardianship is a substantive offence under the Code; but
abduction is an auxiliary act, not punishable by itself, but made criminal only when it is
done with one or other of the intents specified in section 364, et seq.1080.

was in love with the accused and the evidence showed that she left her home on her own
accord and joined the accused for getting their marriage registered and lived as husband and
wife thereafter. Conviction of the accused was set aside because it could not be said that he
kidnapped her. Ram Chandra Singh v Nabrang Rai Burma, 1998 Cr LJ 2156 (Ori), on the same
point.
