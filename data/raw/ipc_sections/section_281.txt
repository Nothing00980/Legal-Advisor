Making atmosphere noxious to health.
Whoever voluntarily vitiates the atmosphere in any place so as to make it noxious to
the health of persons in general dwelling or carrying on business in the
neighbourhood or passing along a public way, shall be punished with fine which may
extend to five hundred rupees.
COMMENT.—
Though concepts of air and ecological pollution are rather new, it must be said to the
credit of the first Law Commission that they too, drafting the code as they did in the
first half of the nineteenth century, were not oblivious of these social needs.
[s 278.1] Smoking in public places.—
There can be no doubt that smoking in a public place will vitiate the atmosphere to
make it noxious to the health of persons who happened to be there. Therefore, smoking
in a public place is an offence punishable under section 278 IPC, 1860.29.
