an offence,
is said to commit "criminal trespass".
State Amendments
Orissa.—Amendment by Orissa Act No. 22 of 1986 (w.e.f. 6-12-1986). Same as in Uttar
Pradesh except that for the words "whether before or after the coming into force of the
Criminal Laws (U.P. Amendment) Act, 1961" read "remains there", and omit "by the
specified in the notice."
Uttar Pradesh.—The following amendments were made by U.P. Act No. 31 of
1961,section 2 (w.e.f. 13-11-1961).
For Section 441, substitute the following:—
"441. Criminal Trespass.—Whoever enters into or upon property in possession of
another with intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in
possession of such property, or, having lawfully entered into or upon such property,
unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such
person, or with intent to commit an offence,
or, having entered into or upon such property, whether before or after the coming into
force of the Criminal Law (U.P. Amendment) Act, 1961, with the intention of taking
unauthorised possession or making unauthorised use of such property fails to
withdraw from such property or its possession or use, when called upon to do so by
that another person by notice in writing, duly served upon him, by the date specified in
the notice,
is said to commit "criminal trespass"."
COMMENT—
The word "trespass" in common english acceptation means and implies unlawful or
unwarrantable intrusion upon land. It is a transgression of law or right, and a trespasser
is a person, entering the premises of another with the knowledge that his entrance is in
excess of the permission that has been given to him.649. The authors of the Code say:
"We have given the name of trespass to every usurpation, however slight, of dominion
over property. We do not propose to make trespass, as such, an offence, except when it
is committed in order to the commission of some offence injurious to some person
interested in the property on which the trespass is committed, or for the purpose of
causing annoyance to such a person. Even then we propose to visit it with a light
punishment, unless it is attended with aggravating circumstances".650.
[s 441.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires—
(1) Entry into or upon property in the possession of another.
(2) If such entry is lawful, then unlawfully remaining upon such property.
(3) Such entry or unlawful remaining must be with intent—
(a) to commit an offence; or
(b) to intimidate, insult, or annoy any person in possession of the property.
The use of criminal force is not a necessary ingredient.
1. 'Enters into or upon property in the possession of another'.—'Property' in this
section means immovable corporeal property, and not incorporeal property such as a
right of fishery,651. or a right of ferry.652. A person plying a boat for hire within the
prohibited distance from a public ferry cannot be said, with reference to such ferry, to
commit criminal trespass.653.
The possession must be actual possession of some person other than the alleged
trespasser.654. The offence can only be committed against a person who is in actual
physical possession of the property in question. If the complainant is not in actual
possession of the property this offence cannot be committed.655. But the offence may
be committed even when the person in possession of the property is absent provided
the entering into or upon the property is done with intent to do any of the acts
mentioned in the section. Where a person entered upon a field that had been leased,
during the absence of the lessee, and ploughed it, and the lessor came to the spot on
hearing of it to prevent the commission of such acts, it was held that that was not
enough to exonerate that person from intention to annoy the lessee and that such a
person could be convicted of criminal trespass.656. The mere taking of unlawful
possession of a house will not amount to either criminal trespass or house-trespass.
An unlawful act is not necessarily an offence. The house in question must be in actual
possession of the complainant. Mere constructive possession is not sufficient.657.
2. 'Intent to commit an offence'.—Where in a pen-down peaceful strike the employees
of the bank entered the office and occupied their seats and refused to work during
office hours and was wholly confined to regular working hours and the only act alleged
against them was that they refused to vacate their seats when they were called upon to
do so by the superior officers, it was held by the Supreme Court that the conduct of
strikers did not amount to criminal trespass.658.
3. 'Or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession'.— In order to establish
that the entry on the property was with intent to annoy, intimidate or insult, it is
necessary for the Court to be satisfied that causing such annoyance, intimidation or
insult was the main aim of the entry; it is not sufficient to show merely that the natural
consequence of the entry was likely to be annoyance, intimidation or insult and this
was known to the accused.659.
The word 'intimidate' must be understood in its ordinary sense "to overawe, to put in
fear, by a show of force or threats of violence". 660.
The Supreme Court has held that this section does not require that the intention must
be to annoy a person who is actually present at the time of the trespass.661.
4. 'Having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there'.— The
original entry may be lawful, but if the person entering remains on the property with the
intent specified in the section he commits trespass. Where a person armed with
weapons went on land of which he was the owner when no one else was there at the
time and refused to vacate it, when called upon to do so by a person who had no right
to the land, it was held that the owner did not remain on the land unlawfully and was
not therefore, guilty of the offence of criminal trespass.662.
[s 441.2] Bona fide claim.—
If a person enters on land in the possession of another in the exercise of a bona fide
claim of right, but without any intention to intimidate, insult, or annoy the person in
possession, or to commit an offence, then although he may have no right to the land,
he cannot be convicted of criminal trespass, because the entry was not made with any
such intent as constitutes the offence.663. Bona fide claim of right, however ill-founded,
nullifies a case of criminal trespass.664. Where certain hutment dwellers of Bombay
were facing demolition for having erected their huts on public footpaths and
pavements, the Supreme Court held that no offence under the section was made out.
Their act was not voluntary. It was the dictate of their moral right to survive and their
state of helplessness. They did not intend to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult
or annoy any person in possession and that is the gist of the offence of criminal
trespass under section 441.665. Where the accused continued in possession of the
tenanted premises even after the expiry of the lease period, he could not be said to be
in unauthorised possession and to have committed trespass.666.
[s 441.3] Dispute as to possession in civil suit.—
Where dispute regarding possession of a property was pending in a civil suit, there
could be no trespass in respect of that property. The complainant must be in
unquestionable possession of property at the time of alleged trespass.667.
[s 441.4] Honest civil trespass.—
A Judicial Magistrate was posted at a place where no Government accommodation
was available. He, therefore, stayed in a room in a dak bungalow. When he went away
on leave, he locked his household effects in the room. A junior engineer broke open the
lock and shifted the belongings to another room as a senior official was to visit the
area. On return, the Magistrate filed an FIR against the junior engineer and cognizance
of the offence was taken. It was held that the engineer was not actuated with any
dishonest intention and it was a case of honest civil trespass for which no cognizance
could be taken.668.
[s 441.5] Uttar Pradesh Amendment.—
The effect of the Uttar Pradesh amendment was considered by the Allahabad High
Court in Somnath Paul v Ram Bharose.669. The amendment has the effect of converting
a civil trespass into a criminal trespass when the entry into, or retention of, premises is
for the purpose of taking unauthorised possession or making unauthorised use. Going
by the earlier authorities, the court held that refusal to vacate premises after revocation
of licence under which possession was given would not by itself constitute a criminal
trespass. The intent to do the acts stated in the amendment must also be proved.670.
[s 441.6] Orissa Amendment.—
Section 441, IPC, 1860, as amended by Orissa Act, 22 of 1986, defines criminal
trespass, which, when committed in respect of, inter alia, a human dwelling, becomes
an offence punishable under section 448, IPC, 1860. Ordinarily, a dispute between the
tenant and the landlord regarding vacation of a premise after expiry of the period of
tenancy is a civil dispute, unless an offence of criminal trespass can be said to have
been committed. Prosecution against the tenant would not lie except the cases
covered by the Orissa Amendment. Section 441, IPC, 1860, which has been defined by
Orissa Act, 22 of 1986, is quoted hereunder for better appreciation:
....... Whoever enters into or upon property in possession of another with intent to commit
an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property.
Or having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there with intent
thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person or with intent to commit an offence;
or having lawfully entered into or upon such property, remains there with the intention of
taking unauthorised possession or making unauthorised use of such property and fails to
withdraw from such property or its possession or use, when called upon to do so by that
another person by notice in writing duly served on him, is said to commit criminal trespass.
The aforesaid section consists of three parts. The first two parts are same and similar
to that of the original section of the IPC, 1860. The third part, with which the charge is
concerned, says that if the person has lawfully entered into the premises and remains
there with intention of (i) taking unauthorised possession or (ii) making unauthorised
use of such property or (iii) fails to withdraw from such property or its possession or
use when called upon to do so by notice in writing duly served on him, he is said to
have committed the offence.671. The rigors of section 441, IPC, 1860 as amended by
the Orissa Act, 22 of the 198 shall not be applicable to the following cases:
(i) Statutory tenants whose tenancy is governed by any statute.
(They are protected by tenancy laws like Public Premises Eviction Act, etc.)
(ii) Tenant who has entered into possession by virtue of a lease.
(Rights of such tenant are governed under the provisions of the Transfer of Property
Act and the Specific Relief Act and he acquires a right of possession. After
determination of tenancy by notice, he would become "Tenant holding over""Tenant on
sufferance" or 'Tenant at will" as the case may be. His possession being juridical, is
protected. He can be evicted only in due process of law. The possession of such
tenant cannot be equated with that of trespassers.)
(iii) Person who has entered into possession by virtue of some covenant like, agreement
to sell, will etc. and/or put forth a genuine right over the property possessed.
(If a person claims a right of title coupled with possession, till the dispute is
adjudicated, his possession cannot be conclusively said to be that of a trespasser and
his right to possess would be subject to the result of the suit or legal proceeding.)672.
