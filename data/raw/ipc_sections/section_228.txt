COMMENT.â€”
Persons who offer resistance or illegal obstruction to the apprehension of other
persons who have committed offences are punishable under this section. The
preceding section punishes the offenders themselves. Section 130 deals with rescuing
a prisoner of State or war and section 186, with rescuing in any other case.
'Rescue' is the act of forcibly freeing a person from custody against the will of those
who have him in custody.366. It has no application to a person who is in lawful custody
and who has offered no resistance or obstruction.367. It is also not necessary that the
rescuing should be done intentionally for in the second part of this section the word
"intentionally" has been deliberately omitted. Thus where a person even in order to
pacify a situation released an accused from the lawful custody of the chowkidar by
untying the turban with which the accused had been tied, it was held that the person so
releasing the accused was clearly guilty of an offence under section 225, IPC, 1860, for
rescuing an offender from lawful custody.368.
One can be held guilty for an offence under section 225 if he rescues a person who
was detained lawfully. Here the word 'rescue' though not defined in the Code, will
always mean an act of getting a person free forcibly from custody against the will of
person in whose lawful custody he was. Therefore, some overt act needs to be there, if
one is said to have rescued a person from the lawful custody.369.
Where the accused obstructed the lawful apprehension of a person and wrongfully
confined two police personnel and the evidence of the prosecution was amply
corroborated and supported by medical evidence, conviction and sentence of the
accused under sections 225, 332 and 342 was upheld.370. The act for which the person
rescued is detained must amount to an offence under the Code. Thus an escape from
custody when being taken before a Magistrate for the purpose of being bound over to
be of good behaviour,371. or an escape from arrest under section 41(2), Criminal
Procedure Code,372. will not fall under this section. If the apprehension is not lawful the
person resisting it will not be guilty of any offence.373.
