Effect caused partly by act and partly by omission.
Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act
or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect
partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence.
ILLUSTRATION
A intentionally causes Z's death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by
beating Z. A has committed murder.
COMMENTâ€”
This section follows as a corollary from section 32. The legal consequences of an 'act'
and of an 'omission' being the same, if an offence is committed partly by an act and
partly by an omission the consequences will be the same as if the offence was
committed by an 'act' or by an 'omission' alone. Fire in the transformer installed in a
cinema hall led to multiple deaths but was not the causa causans of the tragedy. The
absence of rapid dispersal facilities, various acts of omission and commission,
violation of rules and bye-laws meant for public safety were other causes which
contributed to the tragedy in equal proportion. A charge under this section was held to
be justifiable.267.
