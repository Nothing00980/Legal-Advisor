Personation of a Juror or Assessor.
Whoever, by personation or otherwise, shall intentionally cause, or knowingly suffer
himself to be returned, empanelled or sworn as a juryman or assessor in any case in
which he knows that he is not entitled by law to be so returned, empanelled or sworn,
or knowing himself to have been so returned, empanelled or sworn contrary to law,
shall voluntarily serve on such jury or as such assessor, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with
fine, or with both.
COMMENT.â€”
This section was intended to punish personation of a juror or an assessor. It has now
become obsolete with the abolition of assessor or jury system of trial.
