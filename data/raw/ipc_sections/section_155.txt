COMMENT—
Rioting.—A riot is an unlawful assembly in a particular state of activity, which activity is
accompanied by the use of force or violence. It is only the use of force that
distinguishes rioting from an unlawful assembly.54. Under the Common law when
members of an unlawful assembly actually carry out their unlawful common purpose
with violence, so as to cause alarm, they are guilty of riot. For a successful prosecution
of a riot case the prosecution must prove:—
(i) that there were five or more persons;
(ii) that they had a common purpose;
(iii) that they had begun to execute such purpose;
(iv) that they intended to help one another by force, if necessary;
(v) that they had shown such degree of violence which would alarm at least one
person of reasonable courage.
This last mentioned fact need not be proved by calling a person, who has been so
alarmed but it may be made out from facts and circumstances of the case in hand.55.
The ingredients mentioned in item numbers (iv) and (v) above are not to be found at all
in section 146 of IPC, 1860. Where some youths exceeding three were found
demolishing a wall but disappeared the moment the caretaker of the building appeared
at the scene, it was held that they could not be convicted of the offence of riot under
the common law as there was no evidence of show of violence sufficient to alarm one
person of reasonable firmness and courage.56. In the Indian context in this very case
the offence of rioting was complete the moment the youths used force to demolish the
wall for it was not necessary in the Indian law to use force or violence against a person,
far less to cause alarm to a person of reasonable courage and firmness. Force or
violence against an inanimate object too comes within the purview of section 146, IPC,
1860.57.
[s 147.1] Ingredients.—
The following are the essentials of the offence of rioting:—
(1) That the accused persons, being five or more in number, formed an unlawful
assembly.
(2) That they were animated by a common object.
(3) That force or violence was used by the unlawful assembly or any member of it in
prosecution of the common object.
1. 'Force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly'.—The word 'violence' is not
restricted to force used against persons only, but extends also to force against
inanimate objects.58. The words 'force' and 'violence' in this section connote different
and distinct concepts. 'Force' is narrowed down by the definition under section 350 to
persons while the word 'violence' includes violence to property and other inanimate
objects.59.
The use of any force, even though it be of the slightest possible character, by any one
of an assembly once established as unlawful, constitutes rioting.60. Where a member
of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of the assembly throws
down a man and then causes him bodily hurt, the offence of rioting under this section
is complete as soon as the man is thrown down by using force and the hurt
subsequently caused would come under section 323 or section 325.61. The essential
question in a case under section 147 is whether there was an unlawful assembly of five
or more persons. The identity of the persons comprising the assembly is a matter
relating to the determination of the guilt of the individual accused and even when it is
possible to convict less than five persons only, section 147 still applies, if upon the
evidence in the case the Court is able to hold that the person or persons who have been
found guilty were members of an assembly of five or more persons, known or unknown,
identified or unidentified.62. It has been held by the Supreme Court that this section is
not attracted where the act in question was done in pursuit of a lawful object. In this
case the investigating police party was being led by the witness to a spot for recovering
the dead-body. The witness tried to run away and was beaten up with a lathi. He died
shortly thereafter. The Supreme Court did not sustain the conviction of the police
personnel under this section.63.
2. 'In prosecution of the common object'.—Acts done by some members of an unlawful
assembly outside the common object of the assembly or of such a nature as the
members of the assembly could not have known to be likely to be committed in
prosecution of that object are only chargeable against the actual perpetrators of those
acts.64. It is obligatory on the part of the court to examine that if the offence
committed is not in direct prosecution of the common object, it yet may fall under
second part of section 149, IPC, 1860, if the offence was such as the members knew
was likely to be committed. Further inference has to be drawn as what was the number
of persons; how many of them were merely passive witnesses; what were their arms
and weapons. Number and nature of injuries is also relevant to be considered.65.
[s 147.2] 'Resistance to illegal warrant'.—
Resistance to the execution of an illegal warrant within reasonable bounds does not
amount to rioting; but when the right of resistance is exceeded and a severe injury, not
called for, is inflicted, the person who inflicts the injury may be convicted of such
injury.66.
[s 147.3] 'Sudden quarrel'.—
If a number of persons assembled for any lawful purpose suddenly quarrel without any
previous intention or design, they do not commit 'riot' in the legal sense of the word.67.
[s 147.4] 'Fundamental principles in cases of mammoth rioting'.—
(1) Notwithstanding the large number of rioters or of the persons put up in Court for
rioting, and the consequent difficulty for the prosecution to name the specific acts
attributed to each of the accused, the Court must see to it that all the ingredients
required for unlawful assembly and rioting are strictly proved by the prosecution before
convicting the particular accused persons.68.(2) Spectators, wayfarers, etc., attracted
to the scene of the rioting by curiosity, should not be, by reason of their mere presence
at the scene of rioting and with the rioters, held to be members of the unlawful
assembly or rioters. But of course, if they are proved to have marched with the rioters
for a long distance, when the rioters were shouting tell-tale slogans and pelting stones,
it will be for them to prove their innocence under section 106 of the Indian Evidence
Act, 1872. (3) It will be very unsafe, in the case of such a large mob of rioters, to rely on
the evidence of a single witness speaking to the presence of an accused in that mob for
convicting him, especially when no overt act of violence, or shouting of slogan, or
organising the mob, or giving orders to it or marching in procession with it, or other
similar thing is proved against him. In a big riot by hundreds of persons, it is very easy
even to mistake one person for another, and to implicate honestly really innocent
persons, and even, to mistake persons seen elsewhere as having been seen there. An
ordinary rule of caution and prudence will require that an accused person identified
only by one witness, and not proved to have done any overt act, etc., as described
above, should be acquitted, by giving him the benefit of the doubt. (4) Where there are
acute factions based on either agrarian disputes and troubles or on political wrangling
and rivalry or on caste divisions or on divisions of the "haves" and the "have-nots," the
greatest care must be exercised before believing the evidence of a particular witness
belonging to one of these factions against an accused of the opposite view. This
principle becomes of special importance when there are no overt acts, etc., proved, and
when there are only one or two witnesses speaking to the presence of the accused
among the rioters, and they belong to the classes or factions opposed to the accused.
(5) Mere followers in rioting deserve a much more lenient sentence than leaders, who
mislead them into such violent acts, by emotional appeals, slogans and cries.69.
[s 147.5] Offence Compoundable:
When an offence is compoundable under section 320 of Cr PC, 1973, and where the
accused is liable under section 34 or 149 of IPC (45 of 1860) it may be compounded in
like manner.70.
[s 147.6] CASES.—
Where several Hindus, acting in concert, forcibly removed an ox and two cows from the
possession of a Mohammedan, not for the purpose of causing 'wrongful gain' to
themselves or 'wrongful loss' to the owner of the cattle, but for the purpose of
preventing the killing of the cows, it was held that they were guilty of rioting.71. There
was a dispute about the possession of a certain land between the complainant and the
accused. The complainant dug a well with a view to cultivate the said land. The
accused forcibly entered on the land and damaged the well. It was held that the
accused were guilty under this section as an accused person is not entitled to go upon
his own land and by violence destroy the property of the complainant, even though a
trespasser.72.
[s 147.7] No unlawful assembly.—
The accused on receiving information that the complainant's party were about to take
forcible possession of a plot of their land, collected a number of men, some of whom
were armed, and went to the land. While they were engaged in ploughing, the
complainant's party came up and interfered with the ploughing. A fight ensued, in the
course of which one of the complainant's party was grievously wounded and
subsequently died, and two of the accused's party were hurt. It was held that the
accused were justified in taking such precautions as they thought were required to
prevent the aggression, and that they were not members of an unlawful assembly.73.
[s 147.8] Free fight.—
In a free fight there cannot be said to be any formation of an unlawful assembly and
common intention. Each accused will be responsible for his individual act.74.
[s 147.9] Separate trials.—
Where two opposite factions commit a riot, it is illegal to treat both parties as
constituting one unlawful assembly and to try them together, as they cannot have one
common object within the meaning of section 141; each party should be tried
separately.75.
