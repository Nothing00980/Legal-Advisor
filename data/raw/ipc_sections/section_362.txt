Kidnapping.
Kidnapping is of two kinds: kidnapping from 1050.[India], and kidnapping from lawful
guardianship.
COMMENT.â€”
The literal meaning of 'kidnapping' is child stealing.
Kidnapping is of two kinds. But there may be cases in which the two kinds overlap each
other. For instance, a minor may be kidnapped from India as well as lawful
guardianship. A bare perusal of the provisions clearly shows that the legislature did not
confine to constitute the offence only if a minor girl is taken away from the place where
she used to reside but the emphasis is upon taking away the girl from the "lawful
guardianship". Sections 359 and 361, IPC, 1860 do not spell-out any territorial
jurisdiction for committing the offence. In my view the rigour of the law travels with the
ward/subject and any person involving himself or herself in the offence of kidnapping
or procuring a minor girl at any point of time would also come within the purview of
sections 359 and 361, IPC, 1860.1051.
