Mischief by destroying, moving or rendering less useful a light-house
or sea-mark.
Whoever commits mischief by destroying or moving any light-house or other light
used as a sea-mark or any sea-mark or buoy or other thing placed as a guide for
navigators, or by any act which renders any such light-house, sea-mark, buoy or other
such thing as aforesaid less useful as a guide for navigators, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or
with fine, or with both.
COMMENTâ€”
This section is an extension of the principle laid down in section 281. Sea-marks are
very important in navigation and any tampering with them may lead to disastrous
results.
