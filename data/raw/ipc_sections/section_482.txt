[document or electronic record].
COMMENT.—
What this section requires is the use as genuine of any document which is known or
believed to be a forged document; it does not lay down that such use can only occur
when the original itself is produced, for the section does not require the production of
the original.72.
[s 471.1] Ingredients.—
There must be—
1. Fraudulent or dishonest use of a document as genuine.
2. The person using it must have knowledge or reason to believe that the document
is a forged one.
1. 'Uses as genuine'.— Accused registered various documents relating to a project
without verifying the credentials of the purchaser and seller and without examining that
the land covered by the sale deeds was in existence or not or the land belongs to the
State Government. Documents were prima facie found to be forged so as to get the
benefit of the package which was meant for the project affected persons/oustees
displaced from the land. Order of High Court quashing the proceedings was held liable
to be set aside.73.
[s 471.2] Sections 467 and 471.—
Where there is forgery of a document purporting to be a valuable security as defined in
section 471 becomes an offence under section 471 when it is used as genuine. The
Supreme Court observed that the basic ingredient of both the offences is that there
should be "forgery" as defined in section 463 and forgery in turn depends upon creation
of a "false document" as defined in section 464. If there is no "false document" as
defined in section 464, offences under sections 467 and 471 are not made out. Further
the mere execution of a sale deed by claiming that property being sold was executant's
property did not amount to commission of offences under sections 467 and 471 even if
title to property did not vest in the executant. This was for the reason that no "false
document" as defined in section 464, was created.74.
2. 'Knows or has reason to believe to be a forged document'.—These words are of
general application.75. Where it was not shown that the accused had knowledge of the
forged nature of the cheque76. or the lottery ticket77. which he used as genuine he
cannot be convicted under sections 467 and 471, IPC, 1860.
"Knowledge" is an awareness on the part of the person concerned indicating his state
of mind. Reason to believe is another fact of the state of mind. It is not the same thing
as "suspicion" or "doubt". The mere seeing also cannot be equated to believing.
"Reason to believe" is a higher level of the state of mind. Likewise knowledge will be
slightly on a higher plane than reason to believe. A person can be supposed to know
when there is a direct appeal to his senses and a person is presumed to have reason to
believe if he has sufficient cause to believe the same. In substance, what is meant is
that a reason to believe requires that a reasonable man would, by probable reasoning
conclude or infer regarding the nature of the thing concerned. "Knowledge" and "reason
to believe" has to be deduced from the various circumstances of the case.78. The
section is intended to apply to persons other than the forger himself but the forger is
not excluded from the operation of the section. It is not required that the person forging
the document must necessarily be convicted along with the person using the
document.79.
[s 471.3] Compounding.—
Where there is no chance of recording a conviction insofar as the accused is
concerned and the entire exercise of trial is destined to be an exercise in futility, the
High Court by exercising the inherent power under section 482 Cr PC, 1973, even in
offences which are not compoundable under section 320 may quash the
prosecution.80.
[s 471.4] Punishment.—
in Bank of India v Yeturi Maredi Shanker Rao,81. the Supreme Court confirmed the
sentence of nine months of rigorous imprisonment to a person who had knowledge of
the forged signatures on withdrawal forms and who used them to affect withdrawal of
money. A forged will was prepared and executed in favour of the accused, but he could
not draw any benefit under it, nor it was acted upon in any civil proceedings. He had
faced trial for more than 26 years. He was in jail for more than seven months. His
sentence was accordingly reduced to the period already undergone.82. The accused
filed a false marks sheet and gained admission. His past record was good. He had
already lost a job. The sentence of imprisonment was reduced to the period already
undergone.83.
[s 471.5] CASE.—
Accused while working as a lower division clerk in the office of the Deputy
Superintendent of Police had temporarily misappropriated an amount of Rs. 1,839 and
made false entry in the record. Admittedly the sum had been deposited in the post
office before the due date and that no loss had been caused to the department.
Offence alleged under IPC, 1860, against the accused are trivial in nature and have
caused no harm and in fact no offences in the eye of law. The benefit of section 95, IPC
is available to the appellant.84.
[s 471.6] Certificate.—
Where the accused applied to the Superintendent of Police for employment in the
Police force, and in support of his application presented two certificates which he knew
to be false, it was held that he was guilty of offences under sections 463 and 471.85.
Where the accused used a forged certificate of competency as an engine-room first
Tindal, he was held guilty under sections 471 and 463.86. With a view to qualify for
appearance at the competitive P.C.S examination the accused presented a certified
copy of the certificate granted to him by the University at his Matriculation examination,
in which the date of birth had been altered from "5 January 1901" to "15 January 1904".
It was held that he was guilty of an offence under this section inasmuch as the
document presented, being a false document, was used with intent to cause damage
and injury to the other candidates in the competitive examination for P.C.S. and to
support his claim to appear.87. Where a forged certificate of age was filed by an
employee for the purpose of getting his superannuation postponed by two years, his
conviction under sections 471, 420 and 511 was upheld. It was immaterial that the
employer had not acted upon the certificate.88.
[s 471.7] Passport.—
A person who forges a passport and uses it as genuine to get entry into India is guilty
under section 471and section 467.89. Where unauthorised endorsements were made in
a passport with a view to helping the person having his photograph on the passport to
travel to countries to which he was not entitled to go, such endorsements were made
dishonestly and fraudulently and, therefore, the use of such a passport constituted an
offence under section 471, IPC, 1860. Where, however, the very basis of the
prosecution case was that the endorsements were in the handwriting of the accused
but the expert opinion was hesitant and unsatisfactory, the conviction of the accused
could not be sustained.90.
Where passport alleged to have issued by using the former seal of the passport officer,
it is the duty of the investigating officer to find out in whose custody the unused seal
was kept and how the accused obtained possession of the same, for using it for
committing forgery.91.
[s 471.8] Sanction.—
The offence of cheating under section 420 or for that matter offences relatable to
sections 467, 468, 471 and 120B can by no stretch of imagination, by their very nature,
be regarded as having been committed by any public servant while acting or purporting
to act in discharge of official duty. In such cases, official status only provides an
opportunity for commission of the offence.92.
