Limit of punishment of offence made up of several offences.
Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an
offence, the offender shall not be punished with the punishment of more than one of
such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided.
225. [Where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of
any law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, or
where several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves
constitute an offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence,
the offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court
which tries him could award for any one of such offences.]
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of
voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows
which make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow,
he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to
one punishment for the whole beating.
(b) But if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the
blow given to Y is no part of the act whereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is
liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the
blow given to Y.
COMMENT—
The section says that where an offence is made up of parts, each of which constitutes
an offence, the offender should not be punished for more than one offence unless
expressly provided. Where an offence falls within two or more separate definitions of
offences; or where several acts of which one or more than one would, by itself or
themselves, constitute an offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence, the
offender should not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which
tries him could award for any one of such offences. The section governs the whole
Code and regulates the limit of punishment in cases in which the greater offence is
made up of two or more minor offences. It is not a rule of adjective law or procedure,
but a rule of substantive law regulating the measure of punishment, and it does not,
therefore, affect the question of conviction, which relates to the province of procedure.
Section 71 IPC, 1860 as well as section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 talk only of
punishment and not of conviction. Thus, conviction of the accused in respect of the
same act for two different offences is quite legal.226. The section contemplates
separate punishments for an offence against the same law and not under different
laws. Where offences are committed under two separate enactments, section 71 IPC,
1860 is not helpful to the accused and as such, two separate sentences cannot be
questioned by pressing section 71 into service.227. In order to attract provisions of
Article 20(2) of the Constitution, i.e., doctrine of autrefois acquit or section 300 Cr PC,
1973 or section 71 IPC, 1860 or section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897
ingredients of the offences in the earlier case as well as in the latter case must be the
same and not different. The test to ascertain whether the two offences are the same is
not identity of the allegations but the identity of the ingredients of the offence.228.
The rules for assessment of punishment are laid down in sections 71 and 72 of the
IPC, 1860 and section 31 of the Cr PC, 1973. Section 31 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure provides that when a person is convicted at one trial of two or more
offences, the Court may, subject to the provisions of section 71 of the IPC, 1860,
sentence him, for such offences, to the several punishments prescribed therefor which
such Court is competent to inflict; and in the case of consecutive sentences, it shall not
be necessary for the Court, by reason only of the aggregate punishment for the several
offence being in excess of the punishment which it is competent to inflict on conviction
of a single offences, to send the offender for trial before a higher Court. It, therefore,
enhances the ordinary powers of sentences given to Magistrates by section 29, Cr PC,
1973; but in order to bring a case within the purview of this section, the accused must
have been convicted of two or more offences in the same trial, and the sentence for
any one of these offences should not exceed the limits of their ordinary powers. The
limits fixed by this section refer to sentences passed simultaneously, or upon charges
which are tried simultaneously. Sentences of imprisonment passed under it may run
concurrently. When an accused is convicted at one trial of two or more offences,
section 31(1) of Cr PC, 1973 vests discretion in Court to direct that punishment shall
run concurrently. Court may sentence the accused for such offences to several
punishments prescribed therefor, and such punishment would consist of imprisonment
to commence, one after expiration of other in such order as the Court may direct,
subject to limitation contained in section 71 of IPC, 1860.229.
[s 71.1] Illustration (a).—
"A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of
voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which
make up whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be
imprisoned for 50years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for
the whole beating." It is to be noted that the whole beating is considered to constitute
one offence while each of the blows also amounted to the offence of voluntarily
causing hurt. It can be said, therefore, that while the obtaining of money by cheating on
the presentation of an individual bill did constitute the offence of cheating the
obtaining of the entire money in pursuance of the terms of the single contract and the
single conspiracy entered into also constituted the offence of cheating. When the
accused could not be punished with the punishment for more than one such offence it
cannot be the intention of law that the accused be charged with each of the offences,
which were in a way included in the complete offence made up by the entire course of
conduct of the accused in pursuance of the conspiracy.230.
[s 71.2] Section 71 IPC and section 220 Cr PC.—
Section 71 of the IPC, 1860 has to be read in conjunction with section 220 of the Cr PC,
1973. It should, however, be remembered that section 220 Cr PC, 1973 contains only
rules of criminal pleading in regard to joinder of charges and does not deal with the
sentence to be passed on the charges of the offences mentioned in the several
illustrations thereunder. Sub-section (5) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973 makes this position
abundantly clear. A joint reading of section 71 IPC, 1860 and section 220 Cr PC, 1973
clearly shows that clause (2) of section 71 IPC, 1860 approximates sub-section (3) of
section 220 Cr PC, 1973 and clause (3) of section 71 IPC, 1860 corresponds to sub-
section (4) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973. It, therefore, follows that the embargo on
separate sentence under section 71 IPC, 1860 applies only to cases falling within sub-
sections (3) and (4) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973 and not under, for example, sub-section
(1) of that section.231. Thus in cases covered by illustrations (i), (j) and (k) to sub-
section (3) and illustration (m) to sub-section (4) of section 220 Cr PC, though the
offences mentioned therein could be tried together and conviction recorded in regard
to each one of them, yet no separate sentences could be passed in view of the
embargo contained in section 71 IPC, 1860. Similarly, where the accused was
convicted and sentenced under section 147 IPC, 1860 a separate sentence under
section 143 IPC, 1860 could not be passed.232. In the same way when an accused is
convicted for a more serious offence, e.g., under section 148 IPC, 1860 a separate
sentence under section 147 IPC, 1860 is not only uncalled for but illegal.233. It,
therefore, means that cases falling under sub-section (1) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973
where several distinct offences are committed in course of the same transaction, the
accused cannot only be tried and convicted of all of them at one trial but even separate
sentences can be passed in regard to each one of them. Thus, where a person
commits lurking house-trespass by night (section 457 IPC, 1860) and also commits
theft (section 380 IPC, 1860) in course of the same transaction, he can be convicted
and sentenced separately for both of them.234. Though the offence under section 420,
IPC, 1860 and offence under section 138, N.I. Act are very distinct and their ingredients
are different, still both the offences were committed during the same transaction;
accused could have been charged and tried for both the offences during single trial as
per section 220, Cr PC, 1973. However, from the language of section 220, it appears to
be enabling provision whereby two or more different offences may be tried together by
the Court and not mandatory.235.
[s 71.3] CASES.—
1.It was contended that the accused having caused the evidence of the two offences
under sections 330 and 348 to disappear, committed two separate offences under
section 201 and are punishable accordingly. Taking a strict view of the matter, it must
be said that by the same act the appellants committed two offences under section 201.
The case is not covered either by section 71 of the IPC, 1860 or by section 26 of the
General Clauses Act, and the punishment for the two offences cannot be limited under
those sections. But, normally, no Court should award two separate punishments for the
same act constituting two offences under section 201. The appropriate sentence under
section 201 for causing the evidence of the offence under section 330 to disappear
should be passed, and no separate sentence need be passed under section 201 for
causing the evidence of the offence under section 348 to disappear.236. Where death
was caused by rash and negligent driving of a truck and the accused could be
convicted under sections 279 and also under sections 304A, it was held that a separate
sentence under sections 279 could not be imposed.237.
[s 71.4] Rioting and grievous hurt.—
The illustration (a) to section 71 IPC makes it clear that where only an offence is made
up of many parts, and then only, the offender shall not be punished for more than one
such offence. When the offences are separate and distinct and do not constitute parts
of one offence, the accused can be convicted separately for each one of the offences.
Therefore, the argument that the sentence both under sections 148 and 324, IPC is
opposed to section 71, IPC is not acceptable.238.
The provisions of section 31 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have to be read subject
to the provisions of this section and that where anything is an offence falling within two
or more separate definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences
are defined or punished, the offender shall not be punished with more severe
punishment than the Court which tries him could award for anyone of such
offences.239.
3. Same facts constituting different offences.—It has been held that although the act
of the petitioner is only one, namely plying of overloaded vehicle on the public road, he
had committed two distinct offences punishable under two different enactments,
namely (i) violation of the terms of permit and certificate of registration granted by the
authorities which is punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and (ii) causing
damage to the public property which is punishable under the Prevention of Damage to
Public Property Act, 1984. Hence, the claim of the petitioner that he is being punished
more than once for the same offence violating Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India
is neither factually correct nor legally tenable as he is being proceeded against for two
distinct offences punishable under two separate Acts and no parallel procedure for the
same offence is being adopted.240. Prosecution under sections 5 and 6 of Rajasthan
Sati (Prevention) Act 1987 not barred since section 5 makes the commission of an act
an offence and punishes the same while the provisions of section 6 are preventive in
nature and make provision for punishing contravention of prohibitory order so as to
make the prevention effective. The two offences have different ingredients.241.
4. An act giving rise to an offence and an aggravated form of the same offence.—
Section 457 makes punishable lurking house trespass by night or house breaking by
night in order to the committing of any offence punishable with imprisonment and if
the offence intended to be committed is theft, the punishment is higher. Section 380
makes punishable a theft committed in a dwelling house. The two offences do not, in
our opinion, fall under section 71 and, therefore, the conviction under both the sections
is not illegal.242.
