1. 'Carrier'.—A carrier is a person who undertakes to transport the goods of other
persons from one place to another for hire.354. It is clear that the expression 'carrier' in
s.407 IPC, 1860 includes all types of carriers, including a common carrier or a private
carrier.355.
[s 407.1] Jurisdiction.—
Where the accused was entrusted with the carriage of a quantity of coffee from an
estate in Mysore to a firm of merchants in Mangalore, and a portion of the goods was
abstracted and there was no evidence as to when or where such abstraction took
place, it was held that the Magistrate at Mangalore had jurisdiction to try the accused
as there was failure to deliver the goods at Mangalore in accordance with the terms of
entrustment.356.
Where there was misappropriation of goods entrusted for delivery, the Court said that
the Courts at both the places, namely the place of entrustment and place of delivery,
would have jurisdiction.357.
