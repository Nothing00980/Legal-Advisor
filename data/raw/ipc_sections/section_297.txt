Obscene acts and songs.
[Whoever, to the annoyance of others—
(a) does any obscene act in any public place, or
(b) sings, recites or utters any obscene songs, ballad or words, in or near any
public place,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to three months, or with fine, or with both.]
COMMENT.—
Ingredients.—(i) the offender has done any obscene act in any public place or has sung,
recited or uttered any obscene songs or words in or near any public place; and (ii) has
so caused annoyance to others. If the act complained of is not obscene, or is not done
in any public place, or the song recited or uttered is not obscene, or is not sung, recited
or uttered in or near any public place, or that it causes no annoyance to others, the
offence is not committed.163. To fall within the scope of 'obscene' under sections 292
and 294 IPC, 1860, the ingredients of the impugned matter/art must lie at the extreme
end of the spectrum of the offensive matter. The legal test of obscenity is satisfied only
when the impugned art/matter can be said to appeal to an unhealthy, inordinate person
having perverted interest in sexual matters or having a tendency to morally corrupt and
debase persons likely to come in contact with the impugned art. It must also be
remembered that a piece of art may be vulgar but not obscene. In order to arrive at a
dispassionate conclusion where it is crucial to understand that art from the perspective
of the painter, it is also important to picture the same from a spectator's point of view
who is likely to see it.164. The obscene act or song must cause annoyance. Though
annoyance is an important ingredient of this offence, it being associated with mental
condition, has often to be inferred from proved facts. Thus, where a Doctor was filthily
abused in a public place by dragging the name of his wife and he and some members
of the public were impelled to complain to the police, it was held that there was
sufficient indication of the fact that they were all annoyed even though it was not stated
or spoken to by them in their evidence.165.
[s 294.1] Public Place.—
Hotels like the one where cabaret dances are performed and entry is restricted by
purchase of the tickets, would still be the public places within the meaning of section
294 of the IPC, 1860.166. An offence under the section could not be made out by
uttering words in a private garden which was not a public place.167.
[s 294.2] CASES.—
Where the accused addressed openly two respectable girls who were strangers to him,
in amorous words suggestive of illicit sex relations with them and asked them to go
along with him on his rickshaw, he was held to have committed an obscene act.168.
Performance of cabaret dance devoid of nudity and obscenity according to Indian
social standards in hotels and restaurants is not liable to be banned or prevented.169.
[s 294.3] MF Husain's case.—
The renowned artist MF Husain challenged the summoning orders against him which
arose from a contemporary painting celebrating nudity made by petitioner.
Subsequently in the year 2006, the said painting entitled 'Bharat Mata' was advertised
as part of an online auction for charity for Kashmir earthquake victims organised by a
non-governmental organisation with which the petitioner claimed to have no
involvement. It was stated that the petitioner at no point in time had given a title to the
said painting. There can be no exasperation caused by viewing such painting on the
website for the reason that a person would first access such a website only if he has
some interest in art and that too contemporary art, and in case he does view such a
website, he always would have the option to not to view or close the said web page. It
appeared that the complainants are not the types who would go to art galleries or have
an interest in contemporary art, because if they did, they would know that there are
many other artists who embrace nudity as part of their contemporary art. Hence, the
offence alleged under section 294 IPC, 1860, could not be made out.170.
[s 294.4] Cabaret dance.—
In Narendra H Khurana v Commissioner,171. a division bench of Bombay High Court
examined the question whether the nude cabaret dances which are per se indecent and
obscene, held in a restaurant on purchase of tickets would warrant prosecution under
section 294 of the IPC, 1860, in the absence of express evidence of annoyance by any
of the persons who attend such shows. It was held that cabaret dances where indecent
and obscene act per se is involved would not attract the provision of section 294 of the
IPC without fulfilment of its essential ingredients, i.e. Evidence pertaining to
"annoyance to others". In State of Maharashtra v Indian Hotel & Restaurants
Association,172. the Supreme Court lifted the ban on dance bars holding that "we fail to
see how exactly the same dances can be said to be morally acceptable in the
exempted establishments and lead to depravity if performed in the prohibited
establishments. Rather it is evident that the same dancer can perform the same dance
in the high-class hotels, clubs, and gymkhanas but is prohibited of doing so in the
establishments covered under section 33A of Bombay Police Act, 1951. We see no
rationale which would justify the conclusion that a dance that leads to depravity in one
place would get converted to an acceptable performance by a mere change of venue".
[s 294.5] Moral turpitude.—
Offence under section 294 does not involve moral turpitude.173.
[s 294.6] Section 294(b).—
To make out an offence under section 294(b) of IPC, 1860, the alleged obscene act
must have been committed by the accused in or near a public place. Writing obscene
letters and sending them to the victim on her personal address and which were
expected to be read by her privately does not constitute the offence.174.
