"India."
"India" means the territory of India excluding the State of Jammu and Kashmir.]
COMMENTâ€”
This exclusion of the State of Jammu and Kashmir in this section is not violative of
Article 1 and the First Schedule of the Constitution of India.25. In fact, Fazal Ali, CJ, as
he then was, held that exclusion of a territory postulates the existence of a territory
itself; State of Jammu and Kashmir cannot be taken as a foreign territory.26. Since the
First Schedule to the Constitution of India specifically includes Jammu and Kashmir as
a part of the territories of India, the exclusion of the State of Jammu and Kashmir from
section 18 of the Penal Code only means that for the purposes of application of the
provisions of the Indian Penal Code, that State shall not be considered as a part of
India. In fact, section 1 of the Code itself makes this position abundantly clear. The
State of Jammu and Kashmir has a separate Penal Code of its own. It is known as the
Ranbir Penal Code, which is almost same as the Indian Penal Code.
24. Subs. by Act 3 of 1951, section 3 and Sch, for section 18 (w.e.f. 1-4-1951). Earlier section 18
was repealed by the A.O. 1937 and was again inserted by the A.O. 1950.
