Criminal intimidation.
Whoever threatens another with any injury1. to his person, reputation or property, or to
the person or reputation of any one in whom that person is interested, with intent to
cause alarm to that person, or to cause that person to do any act which he is not
legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do,
as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat, commits criminal intimidation.
Explanation.—A threat to injure the reputation of any deceased person in whom the
person threatened is interested, is within this section.
ILLUSTRATION
A, for the purpose of inducing B to desist from prosecuting a civil suit, threatens to burn
B's house. A is guilty of criminal intimidation.
COMMENT.—
The offence of criminal intimidation requires either a person or another in whom he is
specially interested to be threatened. There must be an intent to cause alarm to the
former by a threat to him of injury to himself or to the latter. The intent itself might be
complete, though it could not be effected. But the existence of the interest seems
essential to the offence, as also and equally to the attempt to commit the offence,
since otherwise the attempt would be to do something not constituting the offence.1
[s 503.1] Ingredients.—
(1) Threatening a person with any injury.
(a) to his person, reputation or property or;
(b) to the person or reputation of any one in whom that person is interested.
(2) The threat must be with intent;
(a) to cause alarm to that person, or
(b) to cause that person to do any Act which he is not legally bound to do as
means of avoiding execution of such threat; or
(c) to cause that person to omit to do any act which that person is legally
entitled to do as means of avoiding execution of such threat.
Therefore, intention must be to cause alarm to the victim and whether he is alarmed or
not is really of no consequence. But material has to be brought on record to show that
intention was to cause alarm to that person.2.
1. 'Threatens another with any injury'.—The gist of the offence is the effect which the
threat is intended to have upon the mind of the person threatened, and it is clear that
before it can have any effect upon his mind it must be either made to him by the person
threatening or communicated to him in some way. The threat referred to in this section
must be a threat communicated or uttered with the intention of its being
communicated to the person threatened for the purpose of influencing his mind.3. The
threat must be one which can be put into execution by the person threatening. It is not
necessary that the injury should be one to be inflicted by the offender; it is sufficient if
he can cause it to be inflicted by another; and the infliction of it could be avoided by
some act or omission that the person threatening desires. Punishment by God is not
one which a person could cause to be inflicted or the execution of which he could
avoid.4.
A threat, in order to be indictable, must be made with intent to cause alarm to the
complainant. Mere vague allegation by the accused that he is going to take revenge by
false complaints cannot amount to criminal intimidation.5.
[s 503.2] Criminal intimidation and Extortion.—
Criminal intimidation is analogous to extortion. In extortion the immediate purpose is
obtaining money or money's worth; in criminal intimidation, the immediate purpose is
to induce the person threatened to do, or abstain from doing, something which he was
not legally bound to do or omit.
[s 503.3] Threat of injury to reputation.—
The accused took indecent photographs of a girl and threatened her father, in letters
written to him with publication of the photographs unless "hush money" was paid to
him. The Supreme Court held that the accused was guilty of criminal intimidation and
not of attempt to commit extortion.6. Where the head master of a school threatened a
lady-teacher that until she signed certain papers in blank he would spoil her modesty,
the Supreme Court held that this offence as well as that of extortion were made out.7.
Mere expression of any words without any intention to cause alarm would not be
sufficient to bring in the application of this section.8.
[s 503.4] Person informed about threatened injury to another must be
interested in him.—
A threat to commit suicide is not within the section unless the other person be
interested in the person giving the threat.9.

Nair, 1987 Cr LJ 2074 , when the charge-sheeted employee met the chairman of the company,
the latter remarked to him : "your days are numbered," it was not an intimidation in the context
because the purpose must have been to tell him that his service was not going to last beyond
numbered days.
