Rash driving or riding on a public way.
Whoever drives any vehicle, or rides, on any public way in a manner so rash or
negligent 1 as to endanger human life, 2 or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any
other person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand
rupees, or with both.
COMMENT.—
Under this section the effect of driving or riding must be either that human life was in
fact endangered or that hurt or injury was likely to be caused.
[s 279.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires two things—
1. Driving of a vehicle or riding on a public way.
2. Such driving or riding must be so rash or negligent as to endanger human life or to
be likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person.
1. 'Rash or negligent'.—Rash and negligent driving has to be examined in light of the
facts and circumstances of a given case. It is a fact incapable of being construed or
seen in isolation. The preliminary conditions, thus, are that
(a) it is the manner in which the vehicle is driven;
(b) it be driven either rashly or negligently; and
(c) such rash or negligent driving should be such as to endanger human life.30. The
criminality lies in running the risk of doing such an act with recklessness and
indifference to the consequences. The words "rashly and negligently" are
distinguishable and one is exclusive of the other. The same act cannot be "rash" as well
as "negligent".31. Where negligence is an essential ingredient of the offence, the
negligence to be established by the prosecution must be culpable or gross and not the
negligence merely based upon an error of judgment. Simple lack of care such as will
constitute civil liability, is not enough; for liability under the criminal law, a very high
degree of negligence is required to be proved.32.
There is a distinction between a rash act and a negligent act. A reckless act has to be
understood in two different senses—subjective and objective. In the subjective sense, it
means deliberate or conscious taking of an unjustified risk, which could be easily
foreseen and in the circumstances of the case was unreasonable to take. In the
objective sense, the accused is not conscious of the result though he ought to be
aware that it might follow and in this sense, it is almost equivalent to negligence. In
other words, negligence involves blameworthy heedlessness on the part of the
accused which a normal prudent man exercising reasonable care and caution ought to
avoid. Negligence is an omission to do something, which a reasonable man, guided
upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs,
would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. A
culpable rashness is acting with the consciousness that the mischievous and illegal
consequences may follow, but with the hope that they will not, and often with the belief
that the actor has taken sufficient precaution to prevent their happening. Culpable
negligence is acting without the consciousness, that the illegal and mischievous effect
will follow, but in circumstances which show that the actor has not exercised the
caution incumbent upon him and if he had he would have had the consciousness. As
between rashness and negligence, rashness is a graver offence.33. Negligence is not
an absolute term but is a relative one; it is rather a comparative term. It is difficult to
state with precision any mathematically exact formula by which negligence, or lack of
it, can be infallibly measured in a given case. Whether there exists negligence per se or
the course of conduct amounts to negligence will normally depend upon the attending
and surrounding facts and circumstances which have to be taken into consideration by
the Court. In a given case, even not doing what one was ought to do can constitute
negligence.34. Absence of high speed itself cannot absolve the petitioner from the
culpability.35.
There are several offences in the Code in which the element of criminal rashness or
negligence occurs, viz.,—sections 279, 280, 283–289, 304A, 336, 337, 338.
2. 'Endanger human life'.—It must be proved that the accused was driving the vehicle
on a public way in a manner which endangered human life or was likely to cause hurt or
injury to any other person.36. It is not necessary that the rash or negligent act should
result in injury to life or property.37.
[s 279.2] Reasonable care.—
The Court has to adopt another parameter, i.e., 'reasonable care' in determining the
question of negligence or contributory negligence. The doctrine of reasonable care
imposes an obligation or a duty upon a person (for e.g., a driver) to care for the
pedestrian on the road and this duty attains a higher degree when the pedestrian
happen to be children of tender years. It is axiomatic to say that while driving a vehicle
on a public way, there is an implicit duty cast on the drivers to see that their driving
does not endanger the life of the right users of the road, may be either vehicular users
or pedestrians. They are expected to take sufficient care to avoid danger to others.38.
[s 279.3] Mens rea.—
The essential ingredient of mens rea cannot be excluded from consideration when the
charge in a criminal Court consists of criminal negligence.39.
[s 279.4] Res ipsa Loquitur.—
This doctrine serves two purposes–one that an accident may by its nature be more
consistent with its being caused by negligence for which the opposite party is
responsible than by any other causes and that in such a case, the mere fact of the
accident is prima facie evidence of such negligence. Second, to avoid hardship in
cases where the claimant is able to prove the accident but cannot prove how the
accident occurred. The Courts have also applied the principle of res ipsa loquitur in
cases where no direct evidence was brought on record. Elements of this doctrine may
be stated as:
(a) The event would not have occurred but for someone's negligence.
(b) The evidence on record rules out the possibility that actions of the victim or some
third party could be the reason behind the event.
(c) Accused was negligent and owed a duty of care towards the victim.40. The principle
of res ipsa loquitur is only a rule of evidence to determine the onus of proof in actions
relating to negligence.41. This doctrine operates in the domain of civil law especially in
the cases of torts and helps in determining the onus of proof in actions relating to
negligence. It cannot be pressed 'in service for determining per se the liability for
negligence within the domain of criminal law. Res ipsa loquitur has, if at all, a limited
application in trial on a charge of criminal negligence.42. Where a vehicle was being
driven on a wrong side, accident resulting in the death of two persons, the principle of
res ipsa loquitur should have been applied.43. In the case of Thakur Singh v State of
Punjab,44. the accused drove a bus rashly and negligently with 41 passengers and while
crossing a bridge, the bus fell into the nearby canal resulting in death of all the
passengers. The Court applied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur since admittedly the
petitioner was driving the bus at the relevant time and it was going over the bridge
when it fell down.
[s 279.5] Abetment.—
The mere fact that petitioner was the owner of the offending vehicle at the relevant
time, ipso facto is not a cogent ground to array him as an accused under section 109
IPC, 1860. In this manner, no offence of abetment is made out against the petitioner.45.
[s 279.6] Difference between civil and criminal liability.—
There can be no civil action for negligence if the negligent act or omission has not been
attended by an injury to any person; but bare negligence involving the risk of injury is
punishable criminally, though nobody is actually hurt by it.
If actual hurt is caused the case would come under sections 337 or 338, and if death is
caused, under section 304A.46.
In a case of collision or injury arising out of rash driving, the actual driver and not the
owner of the carriage is liable under this section;47. whereas, in a civil suit, the injured
party has an option to sue either or both of them. In a criminal case, every man is
responsible for his own act; there must be some personal act.48.
[s 279.7] Mechanical failure.—
Poor maintenance of vehicle is itself a negligent act.49. In cases where the prosecution
alleges that the brakes were defective, it must establish by evidence that the brakes
were so defective that the driving of the vehicle endangered human life or was likely to
cause hurt or injury to any other person. Merely because the vehicle swerved to the
right when its brakes were pulled up, it could not be said that there was danger to
human life or it was likely to cause hurt or injury to others.50. Failure to apply brakes at
relevant time does not by itself constitute rash and negligent act for it may as well be
due to error of judgment.51. A vehicle of which handbrake and speedometer were not in
working order is a very serious hazard to the public as the driver would never know his
speed. It is a danger to the traffic in general.52.
[s 279.8] Contributory negligence.—
The doctrine of contributory negligence does not apply to criminal actions.53. The
deceased stood protruding his body out of the vehicle that too having his back towards
the driver, which fact suggests that he himself was quite negligent and responsible for
the accident.54.
[s 279.9] CASES.—
In a case the allegation was that the accused, car driver, drove car in a rash and
negligent manner and caused injury to a child who was playing on side of road. But the
evidence showed that vehicle was going in middle of road and child was also playing
on road. Brake skid marks on road were duly depicted in site plan, acquittal was held
proper by the High Court.55. Where a tractor driver was driving the tractor at a speed of
six miles per hour at night and a man who was sitting on it in a careless fashion
unmindful of bumps and jolts fell down and died, it was held that the driver was not
guilty of any rash or negligent act within the meaning of sections 279 and 304A, IPC,
1860.56. Where a truck dashed against a cyclist and a cart resulting in injuries to both
the cyclist and the cartman but there was no evidence to the actual dashing of the
truck against the cyclist and the cart and no evidence was either available about the
mechanical fitness or otherwise of the truck as the same had been set on fire by an
angry mob, it could not be presumed that the truck must have been driven rashly and
negligently merely because two persons were injured. In the circumstances, the
conviction of the accused under sections 279 and 304A, IPC, 1860 was set aside.57.
Merely because the driver ran away from the spot immediately after the incident, it
could not be said that he must have been driving rashly and negligently.58. Driving at a
high speed or non-sounding of horn by itself does not mean that the driver is rash or
negligent. Place, time, traffic and crowd are important factors to determine rashness or
negligence.59. High speed at a crowded road and pressing a person against a wall in
order to save accident was held to be negligence within the meaning of this section.60.
To drive at a high speed on an empty road or at a lonely place is not the same thing as
driving in a crowded city street.61. Crushing a school child while driving past a school
was held to be ipso facto rashness. Everybody is expected to slow down and take extra
precautions near the vicinity of an educational institution.62. The mere fact that there
are more than two persons in a two-wheeled vehicle will not make out an offence under
section 279, IPC, 1860 as it by itself does not amount to so rash and negligent an act
as to endanger human life, section 279, IPC, 1860 is not attracted where the driving is
ordinarily rash or negligent. Moreover, if an offence is really made out, then driver alone
is responsible and not the pillion rider or riders. Therefore, the police practice of
apprehending all occupants of the vehicle is deprecated.63.
[s 279.10] Site plan.—
Where in a case of rash and negligent driving, the site plan, recovery memo, inspection
report of the offending vehicle were not proved by the prosecution and the investigating
officer was also not examined, conviction of the accused was set aside.64. However,
Supreme Court in a case held that the site plan only indicates the place where the
accident happened and nothing more can be read into it.65.
[s 279.11] Hitting from behind.—
Where the truck of the accused, driven rashly and negligently, hit a bullock-cart from
behind killing the buffalo and the cartman, the accused could not be convicted under
section 429 as the mens rea of causing loss was absent. However, his conviction under
sections 279 and 304-A was upheld.66. Where the accused, bus driver when attempted
to overtake a lorry, on seeing one other bus coming in opposite direction swerved the
bus towards the left and came in a violent contact with the victim, a cyclist, the Madras
High Court held that the very act of the accused in driving the bus and dashing from
behind the cyclist clearly constitutes the rashness and negligence on his part.67.
[s 279.12] Section 279 is not a petty offence.—
'Petty offence' within the meaning of section 206 Cr PC, 1973 is an offence which is
punishable only with fine not exceeding Rs1,000 but does not include any offence so
punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act. If so, section 279 IPC, 1860 which is a
cognizable offence and which is not an offence punishable only with fine is not a 'petty
offences'.68.
[s 279.13] Compounding.—
Though the Supreme Court held in Manish Jalan v State of Karnataka,69. that offences
punishable under section 279 and section 304A, IPC, 1860 are not compoundable, in
Puttuswamy v State of Karnataka,70. the Supreme Court while maintaining the
conviction under section 304A IPC, 1860 notwithstanding the agreement arrived at
between the parties, increased the amount of fine from Rs 2,000 to Rs 20,000 to be
paid to the parents of the deceased and reduced the sentence to the period already
undergone, subject to payment of the fine.
[s 279.14] Sentence.—
One of the most effective ways of keeping drivers under mental vigil is to maintain a
deterrent element in the sentencing sphere. Any latitude shown to them in that sphere
would tempt them to make driving frivolous and a frolic.71. For lessening the high rate
of motor accidents due to careless and callous driving of vehicles, the Courts are
expected to consider all the relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question
of sentence and proceed to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the
offence if the prosecution is able to establish the guilt beyond reasonable doubt.72.
Where the accused dashed the jeep against a tree, as a result of which one person, who
was travelling in the jeep got injured and died, and another person, who was also in the
same vehicle received injuries, the Supreme Court held that the High Court, without
proper appreciation of the evidence and consideration of the gravity of the offence,
showed undue sympathy by reducing the sentence.73.
[s 279.15] Whether a Court can convict a person under sections 279 and 337,
IPC for commission of the same act of offence and accordingly pass sentence
under both the Sections.—
In this case, as the offence having been outcome of the same act, the Court should
punish the accused for one offence and at the same time, while passing the order of
sentence, the Court should also consider that when the sentence prescribed under
section 279, IPC, 1860 is a more severe offence than the offence prescribed under
section 337, IPC, 1860 the accused could be punished under section 279, IPC, 1860
only.74. However, in another case, Madras High Court held that simply because
accused are found guilty under section 304-A IPC, 1860 and sentence is imposed, there
is no embargo for Court to impose separate sentence under section 279 IPC, 1860.75.
