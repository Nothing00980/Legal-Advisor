COMMENT.â€”
The Code provides heavier punishment in cases of offences relating to Indian coin than
those relating to foreign coins.12.
The basic requirement for the prosecution to succeed against the accused in respect
of counterfeiting coins is that the witnesses examined by the prosecution must speak
of the manufacture of one coin resembling a genuine one. A presumption can also be
drawn under Explanation 2 of section 28 that a person is counterfeiting coins when he
causes one coin to resemble another so closely that the person intended to practice
deception or knew it would be likely to cause deception. Section 232 prescribes the
punishment for counterfeiting Indian coins. Section 235 prescribes the punishment for
a person who is in possession of any instrument or material used for counterfeiting
coins. Thus, a conviction under sections 232 or 235 would be maintained only if the
prosecution satisfactorily proves the ingredients of section 28. The prosecution must
establish that the coins manufactured resemble the original. It must also establish that
there is an intention to deceive, or the knowledge that deception would be caused by
such resemblance.13.
'Counterfeiting' means causing one thing to resemble another.14.
