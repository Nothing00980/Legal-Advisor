Knowingly joining or continuing in assembly of five or more persons
after it has been commanded to disperse.
Whoever knowingly joins or continues in any assembly of five or more persons likely
to cause a disturbance of the public peace, after such assembly has been lawfully
commanded to disperse, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.
Explanation.—If the assembly is an unlawful assembly within the meaning of section
141, the offender will be punishable under section 145.
COMMENT—
Effect of command to disperse.—Section 145 punishes the continuance in an unlawful
assembly after it has been commanded to disperse. In this section the assembly need
not be an 'unlawful assembly' but if it is likely to cause a disturbance of the public
peace, then joining or continuing in such assembly after it has been commanded to
disperse is punishable. Section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code confers on a
Magistrate and an officer in charge of a police-station the power to disperse an
unlawful assembly or any assembly of five or more persons likely to cause a
disturbance of the public peace. A bare reading of section 129, Cr PC, 1973, would
make it abundantly clear that a lawful procession or assembly cannot be regarded as
likely to cause a breach of the peace when it is admitted that not they but some other
body of persons is bent on attacking them. Whether an assembly is likely to cause a
disturbance of public peace has to be judged from its own acts and behaviour and not
from the behaviour of another hostile group whose physical opposition may cause a
breach of the peace.164. "Thus, if an assembly other than an unlawful assembly
behaves in such a manner as to provoke a breach of the peace by its own conduct or
action, there would be a justification to order it to disperse under the powers given by
section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But if a religious assembly or procession
remains peaceful in the enjoyment of its legitimate rights and privileges under the law,
it should not be ordered to disperse merely because a body of antagonistic persons
take it into their heads to attack it with a view to provoke a riot. In such a case, it is
rather that body of aggressive persons that constitutes an unlawful assembly and
requires to be sternly dealt with under the law".165. So where a peaceful group of
persons who were cutting crop on their own land refused to disperse on being
commanded to do so by an Inspector of Police merely because another hostile group
objected to the harvesting of the crop, it was held that as these persons were not
commanded lawfully to disperse under section 129, Cr PC, 1973, they could not be
convicted under section 151, IPC, 1860.166. In order to bring a case within the mischief
of this section there must be clear evidence to show that the assembly had been
"lawfully commanded" to disperse. Thus where the police officers in their evidence said
that they had merely warned the two warring factions, it could not be said that the
assembly had been commanded to disperse and as such there was no question of
invoking section 151, IPC, to prosecute the members of the assembly.167.
