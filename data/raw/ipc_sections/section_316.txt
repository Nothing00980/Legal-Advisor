Causing miscarriage without woman's consent.
Whoever commits the offence defined in the last preceding section without the
consent of the woman, whether the woman is quick with child or not, shall be
punished with 695.[imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.—
Under this section the act should have been done without the consent of the woman.
Under it the person procuring the abortion is alone punished; under section 312 such
person as well as the woman who causes herself to miscarry are both punished. Where
the accused woman kicked a pregnant woman in her abdomen resulting in miscarriage,
her conviction under section 313 was sustained.696.
[s 313.1] CASES.—
Section 313 would be attracted only if it is established that the pregnancy is terminated
without the consent of the prosecutrix.697.
695. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, section 117 and Sch, for "transportation for life" (w.e.f. 1-1-1956).
