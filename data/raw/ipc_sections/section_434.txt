COMMENTâ€”
This section deals with fraudulent and fictitious conveyances and trusts. Under it, the
dishonest execution of a benami deed is punishable. Where the consideration for the
sale of immovable property was, with the consent of the purchaser, exaggerated in a
deed of sale in order to defeat the claim of the pre-emptor, it was held that the
purchaser was guilty of this offence.595.
The scope of section 423, IPC, 1860 deals with two specific frauds in the execution of
deeds or instruments of transfer or charge, namely, (i) false recital as to consideration
and (ii) false recital as to the name of beneficiary.596.
The word 'consideration' does not mean the property transferred. An untrue assertion in
a transfer deed that the whole of a plot of land belonged to the transferor is not a
statement relating to the consideration for the transfer and is not an offence under this
section.597.
