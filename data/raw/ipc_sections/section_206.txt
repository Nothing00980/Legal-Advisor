Giving false information respecting an offence committed.
Whoever knowing or having reason to believe that an offence has been committed,
gives any information respecting that offence which he knows or believes to be false,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
192.[Explanation.—In sections 201 and 202 and in this section the word "offence",
includes any act committed at any place out of 193.[India], which, if committed in 194.
[India], would be punishable under any of the following sections, namely, 302, 304,
382, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 402, 435, 436, 449, 450, 457, 458, 459

COMMENT.—
The liability under this section attaches to anyone who gives false information whether
he is legally bound to furnish such information or not. The object of the Legislature is
to discourage and punish the giving of false information to the police concerning
offences which are actually committed and which the person charged with knows, or
has reason to believe, have been actually committed. The section contemplates
information volunteered by some person.
[s 203.1] Ingredients.—
To secure a conviction under section 203, IPC, 1860, the prosecution must prove,
(1) that an offence has been committed;
(2) that the accused knew or had reason to believe that such offence had been
committed;
(3) that he gave the information with respect to that offence;
(4) that the information so given was false;
(5) that when he gave such information he knew or believed it to be false.195.
A complaint against the petitioners/accused for committing an offence under section
203 of the IPC, 1860 would lie only in a case where such accused had voluntarily given
false information in respect of an offence committed knowing or believing it to be
false. Statements given by them to police during investigation of the crime and
recorded under section 161 of the Code even if it is false, will not constitute an offence
under section 203 of the IPC, 1860.196. Where two nuns died due to fall of bricks lifted
by hoist lift without protective measures at construction site. Deed of settlement
purportedly made in the name of a fictitious person so as to save the culpability of the
contractor. Offence made out.197. Where the accused were prosecuted for throttling a
man to death and also for giving for the purpose of screening murder wrong
information that he died of excessive drinking, there being no direct evidence for the
offence of murder, the accused were acquitted of the offence of murder and their
conviction under section 201 was modified into one under section 203 for giving false
information.198. Where petitioners were charged under section 203 and section 211,
IPC, 1860 by the police only to cover up their mishandling of the investigation and their
having falsely charged the petitioners of a crime which never took place, Court ordered
compensation to the petitioners.199.
