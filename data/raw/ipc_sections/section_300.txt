COMMENT.—
This section deals more especially with trespasses on places of sepulchre and places
set apart for the performance of funeral rites and as depositories for the remains of the
dead. It extends the principle laid down in section 295 to places which are treated as
sacred. The essence of the section is an intention, or knowledge of likelihood, to wound
feelings or insult religion and when with that intention or knowledge trespass on a
place of sepulchre, indignity to a corpse, or disturbance to persons assembled for
funeral ceremonies is committed, the offence is complete.39.
1. 'Trespass in any place of worship'.—'Trespass' here implies not only criminal
trespass but also an ordinary act of trespass, i.e., an entry on another's land without
lawful authority with the intention specified in section 441.40. The term 'trespass'
means any violent or injurious act, committed in such place and with such knowledge
or intention as is defined in this section.41.
The trespass must be in a place of worship with the knowledge that the religious
feelings of persons would be wounded thereby. Where some persons had sexual
connection inside a mosque, it was held that they were guilty of an offence under this
section.42.
2. 'Funeral rites'.—The section contemplates disturbance of persons engaged in
performing funeral ceremonies. But a moharram procession is not a funeral ceremony
within the meaning of this section.43. Obstruction to the performance of obsequies
comes under this section.44.
3. Indignity to corpse.—What is indignity to corpse is not defined anywhere. Indignity is
generally synonymous to humiliation or disgrace. A conduct to be criminal in the sense
of section 297, IPC, 1860 should be spiteful to become humiliating or disgraceful. In a
particular situation, an act may not cause disgrace or may not humiliate, but, in other
situations that very act may cause disgrace or humiliation. So the intentions of the
person concerned as well as surrounding circumstances are important factors.45.

for a few minutes in order to show to the public the results of a life in crime. This being not an
indignity to the body, no offence under the section was made out.
