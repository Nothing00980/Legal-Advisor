Delivery of coin, possessed with knowledge that it is counterfeit.
Whoever, having any counterfeit coin, which at the time when he became possessed
of it knew to be counterfeit, fraudulently or with intent that fraud may be committed,
delivers the same to any person, or attempts to induce any person to receive it shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
five years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.—
This section is directed against a person other than the coiner, who procures or obtains
or receives counterfeit coin, and not to the offence committed by the coiner.
Three classes of offences are created by sections 239–243:
(1) Delivery to another of coin, possessed with the knowledge that it is counterfeit
(sections 239, 240).
(2) Delivery to another of coin as genuine, which when first possessed, the deliverer
did not know to be counterfeit (section 241).
(3) Possession of counterfeit coin by a person who knew it to be counterfeit when
he became possessed thereof (sections 242, 243).
