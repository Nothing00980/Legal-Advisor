shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

COMMENT.â€”
This section is framed in order to prevent people from doing acts which are likely to
spread infectious diseases. Welfare of the society is the primary duty of every civilised
State. Section 269, IPC, 1860 makes the negligent act likely to spread infection or
disease dangerous to life as an offence. The essential ingredients are:
(1) that the accused does any act unlawfully or negligently; that such act is likely to
spread infection of any disease dangerous to life; and
(2) that he knows or had reasons to believe that the act is likely to cause such
infection.
Thus causing infection of the disease, which is dangerous to life, is covered by this
section.8. The expression "reason to believe" has been defined under section 26 IPC,
1860 and it lays down that a person said to have "reason to believe" a thing, if he has
sufficient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise. A person can be supposed to
know where there is a direct appeal to his senses. Suspicion or doubt cannot be raised
to the level of "reason to believe".9.
