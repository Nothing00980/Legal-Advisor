Counterfeiting Government stamp.
Whoever counterfeits, or knowingly performs any part of the process of
counterfeiting, any stamp issued by Government for the purpose of revenue, shall be
punished with 37.[imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.—A person commits this offence who counterfeits by causing a genuine
stamp of one denomination to appear like a genuine stamp of a different
denomination.
COMMENT.—
This and the remaining sections of the Chapter deal with offences relating to
Government stamps. These stamps are impressions upon paper, parchment, or any
material used for writing, made by the Government mostly for the purpose of revenue.
A stamp does not cease to be a stamp because it is cancelled. A person selling a
forged stamp, although it bears a cancellation mark commits an offence of selling
forged stamps.38.
37. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, section 117 and Sch, for "transportation for life" (w.e.f. 1 January
1956).
