The Cotton Ginning and Pressing Factories Act, 1925
Act 
No. 12 of 1925
Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The Indian Cotton Committee which was appointed in 1917 in Chapter XVI of their Report Recommended certain measures including the licensing of cotton ginning and pressing factories, to prevent such malpractices as damping, mixing and adulteration, which are injurious to the quality and reputation of Indian cotton. The recommendations of the Committee, however, involved an excessive amount of official interference. The object of the present Bill is to put the trade in a position to protect itself by providing for the marking of bales and the record of ownership, and by providing further that unmarked bales are not tenderable in fulfillment of a contract, if marked bales are demanded by the purchaser.
The Bill also makes provision for the maintenance of register for statistical returns, for the use of correct scales and weights, and for the structural improvement of ginning and pressing factories. The Bill is based on the recommendations of the Indian Central Cotton Committee, and is supplementary to the Cotton Transport Act, 1923."
