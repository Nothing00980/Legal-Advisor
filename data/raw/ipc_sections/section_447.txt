COMMENTâ€”
In order to attract section 436 of the IPC, 1860, the following ingredients must be
satisfied:
(i) There must be commission of mischief by fire or any explosive substance.
(ii) It should have been committed intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely that
the accused will thereby cause the destruction of any building.
(iii) The building should be one which is ordinarily used as a place of worship or as
a human dwelling or as a place for custody of property.
The section contemplates the destruction of a building. A 'building' is not necessarily a
finished structure.645. An unfinished house, of which the walls are built and finished,
the roof on and finished, a considerable part of the flooring laid, and the internal walls
and ceiling prepared ready for plastering is a building.646. The dominant intention of
the Legislature in framing section 436, IPC, 1860, was to give protection to those
buildings which are used as human dwelling or as places where properties are stored
for custody.
