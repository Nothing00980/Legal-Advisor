"Person".
The word "person" includes any Company or Association or body of persons, whether
incorporated or not.
COMMENT—
The term 'person' has been defined in section 11, IPC, 1860, and the same is in pari
materia with section 3(42) of the General Clauses Act 1897. Obviously, the definition is
inclusive.9. A natural person, an incorporated person or even an unincorporated
association or body of persons like a partnership can be a person under section 11 of
IPC, 1860.10. The Supreme Court has held in Standard Chartered Bank v Directorate of
Enforcement,11. that, as regards corporate criminal liability, there is no doubt that a
corporation or company could be prosecuted for any offence punishable under law,
whether it is coming under the strict liability or under absolute liability. A juristic person
has been held to come within the meaning of the word "person" for the purposes of
section 415 (cheating).12.
The State and its instrumentalities are juristic persons,13. but by implication, the State
stands excluded from the purview of the word 'person' for the purpose of limiting its
right to avail the revisional power of the High Court under section 397(1) of Cr PC, 1973
for the reason that the State, being the prosecutor of the offender, is enjoined to
conduct prosecution on behalf of the society and to take such remedial steps as to
deems proper.14. Chief Educational Officer is an artificial person/ juristic person falling
under section 11 of IPC, 1860.15.
[s 11.1] Accused person.—
Though the word "person" is defined in the Indian Penal Code section 11 and the
General Clauses Act section 3(42) which are identical and are not exhaustive but an
inclusive one. The words "accused" or "accused person" or "accused of an offence" are
not defined either in the Indian Penal Code or in the Indian Evidence Act or in the
General Clauses Act 1897.16.
[s 11.2] Complainant.—
A complaint can be filed in the name of a juristic person because it is also a person in
the eye of law. It is clear that complainant must be a corporeal person who is capable
of making a physical presence in the court. Its corollary is that even if the complaint is
made in the name of incorporeal person (like a company or corporation) it is necessary
that a natural person represents such juristic person in the court and it is that natural
person who is looked upon, for all practical purposes, to be the complainant in the
case. In other words, when the complainant is a body corporate it is the de jure
complainant, and it must necessarily associate a human being as de facto complainant
to represent the former in court proceedings.17. A company is a person in law and not
in fact. A person in law is always required to be represented by a person in fact. A
company can file a complaint for Defamation (section 500 IPC, 1860) through its
authorised representative.18.
