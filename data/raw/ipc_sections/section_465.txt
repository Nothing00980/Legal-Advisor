State Amendment
Tamil Nadu.—The following amendments were made by Tamil Nadu Act No. 28 of 1993,
Section 4.
Section 454 of the Principal Act, shall be renumbered as sub-section (1) of that section
and after sub-section (1) as to renumbered, the following sub-section shall be added,
namely:—
"(2) Whoever commits lurking house-trespass or house-breaking in any building used
as a place of worship, in order to the committing of the offence of theft of any idol or
icon from such building, shall notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), be
punished with rigorous imprisonment which shall not be less than three years but
which may extend to ten years and with fine which shall not be less than five thousand
rupees:
Provided that the court may, for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the
judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than three years."
COMMENT—
This is an aggravated form of the offence described in the last section. The latter
portion of this section is framed to include the cases of house-trespassers and house-
breakers by night who have not only intended to commit, but have actually committed,
theft.716. Though the relationship between parties is of landlord and tenant and
accused is tenant in complainant's premises, It cannot be said that origin of dispute
being of civil nature. It is held that criminal proceedings are maintainable.717.

In view of the conviction for section 454 of the IPC, 1860, separate conviction for the
offence under section 380 of the IPC, 1860 is not needed as the offence under section
