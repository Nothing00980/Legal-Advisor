Rioting armed with deadly weapon.
Whoever is guilty of rioting, being armed with a deadly weapon or with anything
which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with
fine, or with both.
COMMENT—
Rioting with deadly weapons.—Similar to section 144, this section is an aggravated
form of the offence mentioned in the previous section. Enhanced punishment is
provided for the person who is armed with a deadly weapon while committing the
offence of rioting. This section cannot be read with section 149.76.
Where out of the 45 accused persons convicted by the High Court 36 had been
identified as members of the assembly by a solitary witness, the Supreme Court said
that it was not safe to place reliance in reference to the accused about whom no other
witness said that they were a part of the assembly. Their conviction was held to be
unsustainable. So far as the remaining accused were concerned, the prosecution had
proved the charge against them under section 148 and therefore their acquittal by the
High Court was not justified.77.
Where several persons assaulted the victim, the court said that it was not necessary
that the death of the victim must be attributed to a particular injury or to a particular
assailant. All of them are liable for conviction for causing death of the victim with the
common object of the unlawful assembly.78.
[s 148.1] Charge under section 147/148; Conviction under section 149.—
The Constitution Bench in Mahadev Sharma v State of Bihar,79. held that if a charge had
been framed under section 147 or section 148 and that charge had failed against any
of the accused then section 149 could not have been used against him. The area which
is common to sections 147 and 149 is the substratum on which different degrees of
liability are built and there cannot be a conviction with the aid of section 149 when
there is no evidence of such substratum. The accused have been expressly charged for
the offence punishable under section 148, IPC, 1860, and have been acquitted
thereunder, they cannot be legally convicted for the offence punishable under section
302 read with section 149, IPC. It is so because the offence of rioting must occur when
members are charged with murder as the common object of the unlawful assembly.
The offences under sections 147 and 148 are distinct offences.80. Section 148, IPC
creates liability on persons armed with deadly weapons and is a distinct offence and
there is no requirement in law that members of unlawful assembly have also to be
charged under section 148, IPC for legally recording their conviction under section 302
read with section 149, IPC. However, where an accused is charged under section 148,
IPC and acquitted, conviction of such accused under section 302 read with section
149, IPC could not be legally recorded.81.
