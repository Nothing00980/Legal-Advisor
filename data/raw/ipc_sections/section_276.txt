COMMENT.—
It is not an offence to sell inferior food cheap if it is not noxious.
[s 273.1] Ingredients.—
This section requires three things—
(1) Selling or offering for sale as food or drink some article.
(2) Such article must have become noxious or must be in a state unfit for food or drink.
(3) The sale or exposure must have been made with a knowledge or reasonable belief
that the article is noxious as food or drink. The word "noxious" as stated in Advanced
Law Lexicon by P Ramanatha Aiyar (3rd Edition Reprint 2009), when used in relation to
article of food is to mean that the article is poisonous, harmful to health or repugnant
to human use. Having regard to language used in section 273, noxious food or drink,
literally would mean article of food or drink which earlier was not noxious, but should
have become noxious or had been rendered noxious by lapse of time or by not taking
proper precaution or for not adding preservatives or the like.23.
What is punishable under this section is the sale of noxious articles as food or drink
and not the mere sale of noxious article. Where the owner of a grain pit sold the
contents of it before it was opened at a certain sum per maund whether the grain was
good or bad, and on the pit being opened it was found that a large proportion of the
grain was unfit for human consumption, it was held that the vendor could not be
convicted under this section.24. Similarly, the selling of wheat containing a large
admixture of extraneous matter, such as dirt, wood, matches, charcoal, was held to
constitute no offence.25.
