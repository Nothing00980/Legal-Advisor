Punishment for dacoity.

rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be
liable to fine.
COMMENT—
188..—When a person is involved in an offence of theft of higher magnitude, then it
becomes dacoity and when dacoity is committed with murder and also results in
causing grievous hurt to others, it becomes robbery punishable under sections 395,
section 396 and section 397 of IPC, 1860. In other words, when the offence of theft is
committed conjointly by five or more persons, it becomes dacoity and such dacoity by
those persons also results in commission of murder as well as causing of grievous
hurt to the victims, it results in an offence of robbery. A reading of section 395, section
396 and section 397 of IPC, 1860 makes the position clear that by virtue of the conjoint
effort of the accused while indulging in the said offence, makes every one of them
deemed to have committed the offence of dacoity and robbery. In the result, when such
offences of dacoity and robbery are committed, the same result in the death of a
person or hurt or wrongful restrain or creating fear of instant death or instant hurt or
instant wrongful restraint. In substance, in order to find a person guilty of offences
committed under sections 395, 396 and 397 of IPC, 1860, his participation along with a
group of five or more persons indulging in robbery and in that process commits murder
and also attempts to cause death or grievous hurt with deadly weapons would be
sufficient. Use of a knife in the course of commission of such a crime has always been
held to be use of a deadly weapon. Keeping the above basic prescription of the offence
described in the above provisions in mind, we examined the case on hand. In the first
instance, what is to be examined is whether the basic ingredient of the offence falling
under section 395, section 396 and section 397 of IPC, 1860, namely, participation of
five or more persons was made out.189.
[s 395.1] Cases.—
In T Alias Sankaranarayanan v State Rep. By Inspector of Police,190. allegation was that
accused along with others entered the premises of complainant in false pretext of
conducting income tax raid and looted jewels and cash. Accused acquitted since there
was no TIP and accused was identified for first time in Court after seven years of
occurrence.
[s 395.2] Sentence.—
Dacoity is a daredevil act. Most of the time, a serious crime like dacoity is committed
by unknown persons and it is very difficult to trace them and still difficult to secure their
conviction. As a matter of fact, looking to the nature of crime and the manner in which
the appellants looted temple properties, graver punishment was warranted. In any case,
sentence of five years rigorous imprisonment awarded by the trial Court and confirmed
in appeal by the High Court for the offence under section 395 IPC, 1860 calls for no
interference.191.
Considering that the value of the alleged loot including cash and mobile was only Rs.
16,550 and the young age of the accused, the trial Court sentenced him to rigorous
imprisonment of only one year along with a fine of Rs. 100. The High Court allowed the
appeal to the extent of enhancing the sentence to five years of rigorous imprisonment
along with the fine imposed by the trial Court. Considering the same reasons as
recorded by the trial Court the Supreme Court reduced the sentence of imprisonment to
the extent already undergone, i.e., three years and two months.192.

Chaudhary v State of Bihar, 2002 Cr LJ 1424 (Pat), no leniency in terms of punishment was
shown to dacoits who had robbed innocent bus passengers of their belongings irrespective of
the fact that the accused persons had been facing the rigour of the trial for 14 years. Praful
