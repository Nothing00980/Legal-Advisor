[s 221.1] CASE.—
Where a constable acting as a Court Moharrir instead of sending the accused to jail
custody as ordered by the Magistrate directed his release and thus allowed him to
escape, it was held that the release being in violation of his legal obligation to have the
accused detained in jail custody, the Moharrir was clearly liable under section 221, IPC,
1860.338. Accused was entrusted with escort duty for the convict to the Hospital.
Convict was the younger brother of accused's wife. Accused allowed him to escape
from Custody. The Karnataka High Court upheld the conviction under sections 221, 222
and 223.339.
