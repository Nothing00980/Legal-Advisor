Rash navigation of vessel.
Whoever navigates any vessel in a manner so rash or negligent as to endanger human
life, or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with
fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.
COMMENT.—
The last section deals with public ways on land: this section deals with waterways. It
deals with the case of inland navigation. Rash or negligent navigation on the high seas
is not punished under the Code but under certain special statutes.
[s 280.1] CASES.—
Petitioners, 33 in number were the distressed and marooned seamen belonging to
different nationalities who were the crew of "ISABELL-III", wrecked at the reefs of the
sea near the Islet of Suheli Par, part of the Lakshadweep group of Islands. The accident
happened when the vessel was passing through the Indian territorial waters by way of
innocent passage; and immediately the matter was informed to the Indian Coast
Guard. The Merchant Shipping (Distressed Seamen) Rules, 1960 prescribes that the
derelict seamen should be saved at any cost and repatriated to their return port at the
cost of the owner of the vessel. The petitioners were forced to enter the Lakshadweep
Island and hence they were held protected under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 the
Merchant Shipping (Distressed Seamen) Rules, 1960 and the U.N. Conventions On the
Law Of the Sea (UNCLOS). It was held that at best the offence under section 280 IPC,
1860, i.e., rash navigation of the vessel, would lie only against the first accused, who
was the Master of the vessel. Proceedings against the crew was quashed.76.
