COMMENT.—
This section resembles sections 242, 243 and 259.
The offence under section 474, IPC, 1860, is made out by the mere fact of possession
of forged documents knowing them to be forged and intending the same to be
fraudulently and dishonestly used. So even if such documents are not actually used, it
need not absolve the accused from the mischief of provisions contained in section 474,
IPC. Thus, where the accused falsely posed as an I.A.S. officer and as a Joint Director
(Vigilance) attached to the Central Bureau of Investigation and was also found in
possession of fictitious documents supporting such claim and such documents were
being created by him from time to time with a view to entangle people in bogus
criminal cases, it was held that the accused was an impostor and had intended to use
these faked documents in furtherance of his criminal design. He was, therefore, rightly
convicted under section 474, IPC.96.
