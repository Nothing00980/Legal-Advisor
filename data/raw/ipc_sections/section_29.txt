"Dishonestly.".
Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or
wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing "dishonestly".
COMMENT—
From this definition it will appear that the term 'dishonestly' is not used in the Code in
its popular significance. Unless there is wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss
to another, an act would not be 'dishonest'. Wrongful gain includes wrongful retention
and wrongful loss includes being kept out of the property as well as being wrongfully
deprived of property.117. An act done with the intention to cause 'wrongful gain' can be
said to be dishonest.118. Deceit is not an ingredient of the definition of the word
"dishonestly". "Dishonestly" involves a pecuniary or economic gain or loss.119. Thus,
"dishonestly" means an intention to cause either wrongful gain or wrongful loss. So
where municipal officers demolished and removed an unauthorised structure lawfully
by virtue of powers given to them under the Municipal Act, it could not be said that they
committed the offence of theft under section 380, IPC, 1860, as their act was not
committed dishonestly within the meaning of section 24 read with section 23, IPC,
1860. And since "dishonesty" is an essential ingredient of the offence of theft, they
could not be charged with that offence.120. A mere erroneous belief and persistence in
a wrong or perverse opinion cannot be said to be offence tainted with a dishonest or
fraudulent intent.121.
[s 24.1] Cheating.—
Two main ingredients of section 420 IPC, 1860 are dishonest and fraudulent
intention.122. For the purpose of establishing the offence of cheating, the complainant
is required to show that the accused had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time
of making promise or representation.123.
[s 24.2] Breach of Trust.—
The element of 'dishonest intention' is an essential element to constitute the offence of
Criminal Breach of Trust.124.
[s 24.3] Hire-purchase.—
The element of 'dishonest intention' which is an essential element to constitute the
offence of theft cannot be attributed to a person exercising his right under an
agreement entered into between the parties as he may not have an intention of causing
wrongful gain or to cause wrongful loss to the hirer.125.
