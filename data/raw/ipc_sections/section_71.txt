Sentence of imprisonment for non-payment of fine.
191. [In every case, of an offence punishable with imprisonment as well as fine, 1 in
which the offender is sentenced to a fine, whether with or without imprisonment, and
in every case of an offence punishable 192.[with imprisonment or fine, or] with fine
only, in which the offender is sentenced to a fine,] it shall be competent to the Court
which sentences such offender to direct by the sentence that, in default of payment of
the fine, the offender shall suffer imprisonment for a certain term, in which
imprisonment shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to which he may have
been sentenced or to which he may be liable under a commutation of a sentence.
COMMENT—
The term of imprisonment in default of payment of fine is not a sentence. It is a penalty
which a person incurs on account of non-payment of fine. The sentence is something
which an offender must undergo unless it is set aside or remitted in part or in whole
either in appeal or in revision or in other appropriate judicial proceedings or "otherwise".
A term of imprisonment ordered in default of payment of fine stands on a different
footing. A person is required to undergo imprisonment either because he is unable to
pay the amount of fine or refuses to pay such amount. He, therefore, can always avoid
to undergo imprisonment in default of payment of fine by paying such amount. It is,
therefore, not only the power, but also the duty of the Court to keep in view the nature
of offence, circumstances under which it was committed, the position of the offender
and other relevant considerations before ordering the offender to suffer imprisonment
in default of payment of fine.193. A default sentence is no punishment under law. It is
only a method of enforcement of the direction for payment of amounts directed to be
paid as fine. Wherever the Criminal Court has the jurisdictional competence to impose
a fine, sections 64–70, IPC, and section 30 Cr PC, 1973 stipulate that the Court can
recover the same by imposition of a default sentence. The jurisdiction to impose a
default sentence is only incidental to the power to impose a fine and the duty of the
Court to recover the same.194. The wording of the section is not happy, but the
Legislature intended by it to provide for the award of imprisonment in default of
payment of fine in all cases in which fine can be imposed to induce the offender to pay
the fine.
The cases falling under this section are:—
Where the offence is punishable with (a) imprisonment with fine, or (b) imprisonment
or fine, or (c) fine only, and the offender is sentenced to (i) imprisonment, or (ii) fine, or
both, the Court may sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment in default of
payment of fine. A term of imprisonment for non-payment of fine is not a substantive
sentence. It is only a penalty for the default. It cannot be added to the substantive
sentence so as to see whether the maximum imprisonment that could be awarded for
the offence is not being exceeded.195.
1. 'Imprisonment as well as fine.'—Magistrates cannot award compensation in addition
to fine.196.
The full Bench of Madras High Court held that imprisonment in default of payment of
fine cannot be directed to run concurrently with substantive sentence because both the
sentences are distinct in view of sections 53 and 64 IPC, 1860.197.
[s 64.1] Sentence and penalty distinguished.—
The term of imprisonment in default of payment of fine is not a sentence. It is penalty
incurred for non-payment of fine. A sentence is a term of imprisonment, which the
offender has to undergo unless it is remitted in a further judicial proceeding or
otherwise. A term of imprisonment on default in payment of fine stands on a different
footing. The further imprisonment is due to non-payment by refusal or otherwise. The
convict can pay the amount and get rid of further imprisonment.198.
[s 64.2] Fine and Compensation.—
There exists a distinction between fine and compensation, although, in a way it seeks
to achieve the same purpose. An amount of compensation can be directed to be
recovered as a 'fine' but the legal fiction raised in relation to recovery of fine only, it is in
that sense 'fine' stands on a higher footing than compensation awarded by the
Court.199.
[s 64.3] Power of Magistrate to impose Sentence of imprisonment in default of
fine.—
As per section 30 of Cr PC, 1973 the Court of a Magistrate may award such term of
imprisonment in default of payment of fine as is authorised by law: provided that the
term is not in excess of the powers of the Magistrate under section 29 Cr PC, 1973; and
shall not, where imprisonment has been awarded as part of the substantive sentence,
exceed one-fourth of the term of imprisonment which the Magistrate is competent to
inflict as punishment for the offence otherwise than as imprisonment in default of
payment of the fine. The imprisonment awarded may be in addition to a substantive
sentence of imprisonment for the maximum term awardable by the Magistrate under
section 29 of Cr PC, 1973. The default sentence is not to be in excess to the limitations
imposed under section 30 Cr PC, 1973.200.
[s 64.4] Default sentence on non-payment of Compensation.—
Undoubtedly, there is no specific provision in the Code which enables the Court to
sentence a person who commits breach of the order of payment of compensation. But
in Hari Singh v Sukhbir Singh,201. Supreme Court held that since the imposition of
compensation under section 357(3) Cr PC, 1973 was on account of social concern, the
Court could enforce the same by imposing sentence in default, particularly when no
mode had been prescribed in the Code for recovery of sums awarded as compensation
in the event the same remained unpaid. The position is re-iterated in Sugnathi Suresh
Kumar v Jagdeeshan.202. The provisions of sections 357(3) and 431 Cr PC, 1973 when
read with section 64 IPC, 1860 empower the Court, while making an order for payment
of compensation, to also include a default sentence in case of non-payment of the
same.203.
