COMMENT—
The words "valuable security" also occurs in sections 329–331, 347, 348, 420, 467 and
471. Account books containing entries not signed by a party are not "valuable
security."157. A copy of a valuable security is not a valuable security.158. An 'order of
assessment' is a 'valuable security'.159.
1. 'Which is, or purports to be'.—The use of the words "which is, or purports to be"
indicates that a document which, upon certain evidence being given, may be held to be
invalid, but on the face of it creates, or purports to create, a right in immoveable
property, although a decree could not be passed upon the document, comes within the
purview of this section.160. The words "purports to be" are wide enough to include a
document which is not in conformity with the provisions of the Registration Act. Such a
document though not otherwise receivable in evidence would still be receivable in
evidence for the purpose of the Indian Penal Code.161. However, certificates which the
accused had forged in order to get admission in a college could not be described as
"valuable security" and as such their conviction under section 471 read with section
467 had to be changed to one under section 471 read with section 465, IPC, 1860.162.A
lottery ticket is a valuable security.163.
