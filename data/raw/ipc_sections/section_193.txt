State Amendment
Andhra Pradesh.—Offence under section 190 is cognizable.
[Vide A.P.G.O. Ms. No. 732, dated 5th December, 1991].
COMMENT—
The object of this section is to prevent persons from terrorising others with a view to
deter them from seeking the protection of public servants against any injury. Where a
clergyman, knowing that a civil suit was pending against a person for the possession of
certain church property, excommunicated him for withholding it, it was held that the
clergyman had committed no offence under this section. By a notification under
section 10(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932 the State Government can
make this offence a cognizable one for a specified area while such notification remains
in force.
