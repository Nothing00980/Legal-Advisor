COMMENTâ€”
The offence under this section is an aggravated form of the offence described in
section 453.
This and the following section provide for a compound offence, the governing incident
of which is that either a 'lurking house-trespass' or 'house-breaking' must have been
completed in order to make a person, who accompanies that offence either by causing
grievous hurt or attempt to cause death or grievous hurt, responsible under those
sections.727.
During the period house-breaking lasts, if the trespasser causes grievous hurt to any
person or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt, the provisions of this section will
be attracted. It cannot be accepted that it is only in the process of making an entry into
a house if the trespasser causes grievous hurt, that this section will be attracted, for,
the essential ingredient of lurking house-trespass or house- breaking is 'criminal
trespass' and that offence continues so long as the trespasser remains on the property
in possession of another.728.
