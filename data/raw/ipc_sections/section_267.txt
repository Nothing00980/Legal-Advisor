Fraudulent use of false instrument for weighing.
Whoever fraudulently uses any instrument for weighing which he knows to be false,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.â€”
Intention is an essential part of the offence under this section. The section requires two
things: (1) fraudulent use of any false instrument for weighing, and (2) knowledge that
it is false. The word 'false' in this and the following sections means different from the
instrument, weight, or measure, which the offender and the person defrauded have
fixed upon, expressly or by implication, with reference to their mutual dealings. Where it
was agreed between the seller and purchaser that a particular measure was to be used
in measuring the commodity sold, it was held that, even though the measure was not of
the standard requirement, it was not 'false' and there was no fraudulent intent within
the meaning of this section.1.
