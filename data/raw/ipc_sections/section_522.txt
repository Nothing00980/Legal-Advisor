COMMENT.—
Before completion of crime, human mind has to pass four steps as under:—
(1) Intention to commit;
(2) Preparation to commit it;
(3) Attempt to commit it; and
(4) If the attempt is successful, then crime is complete.
Section 511 Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) is a general provision dealing with the
attempts to commit offences and not made punishable by other specific section. It
makes punishable all attempts to commit offences punishable with imprisonment and
not only those punishable for life or death.3.
A person commits the offence of 'attempt to commit a particular offence' when (i) he
intends to commit that particular offence; and (ii) he, having made preparations and
with the intention to commit the offence, does an act towards its commission; such an
act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of that offence, but must
be an act during the course of committing that offence, section 511, IPC, 1860 is
attracted.4. An attempt to commit an offence is an act, or a series of acts, which leads
inevitably to the commission of the offence, unless something, which the doer of the
act neither foresaw nor intended, happens to prevent this. An attempt may be
described to be an act done in part execution of a criminal design, amounting to more
than mere preparation, but falling short of actual consummation, and, possessing,
except for failure to consummate, all the elements of the substantive crime. In other
words, an attempt consists in it the intent to commit a crime, falling short of, its actual
commission or consummation/completion. It may consequently be defined as that
which if not prevented would have resulted in the full consummation of the act
attempted. The illustrations given in section 511 clearly show the legislative intention
to make a difference between the cases of a mere preparation and an attempt.5.
In Om Prakash's case6. the Supreme Court has clearly held that like section 511, IPC,
1860 in section 307, IPC, 1860 to the act need not be the penultimate act.
[s 511.1] Essentials.—
In every crime, there is first intention to commit it; second, preparation to commit it;
third, attempt to commit it. If the third stage, that is attempt is successful, then the
crime is complete. If the attempt fails, the crime is not complete but the law punishes
the person attempting the act. An 'attempt' is made punishable, because every attempt,
although it fails of success, must create alarm, which, of itself, is an injury, and the
moral guilt of the offender is the same as if he had succeeded.
A culprit first intends to commit the offence, then makes preparation for committing it
and thereafter attempts to commit the offence. If the attempt succeeds, he has
committed the offence, if it fails due to reasons beyond his control, he is said to have
attempted to commit the offence. Attempt to commit an offence can be said to begin
when the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do something with
the intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of
the offence. The moment he commences to do an act with the necessary intention, he
commences his attempt to commit the offence—the act need not be the penultimate
act towards the commission of the offence but it must be an act during the course of
committing that offence.7.
(1) Intention.—Intention is the direction of conduct towards the object chosen upon
considering the motives which suggest the choice.8. The will is not to be taken for the
deed, unless there be some external act which shows that progress has been made in
the direction of it, or towards maturing and affecting it. In an attempt to commit an
offence, there must be intention to commit the crime combined with doing of some act
adopted to, but falling short of its actual commission.9.
(2) Preparation.—Preparation consists in devising or arranging the means or measures
necessary for the commission of an offence.10.
[s 511.2] Removal of rice bags from godown in order to sell them.—
A Government stockist removed 80 bags of rice from a godown in his charge and
concealed them in a room with a view to sell them and appropriate the sale proceeds. It
was held that the act of the stockist amounted only to preparation and therefore, he
was not guilty of any offence.11.
[s 511.3] Running towards well for committing suicide.—
A woman ran to a well stating she would jump into it, and she was caught before she
could reach it. It was held that she could not be convicted of an attempt to commit
suicide as she might have changed her mind before jumping into the well.12.
(3) Attempt.—Attempt is the direct movement towards the commission after the
preparations are made.13. In State of Maharashtra v Mohd. Yakub,14. reported in the
Apex Court considered the definition of 'attempt to commit crime' as the last proximate
act which a person does towards the commission of an offence, the consummation of
the offence being hindered by circumstances beyond his control. It was observed by
the Apex Court that what constitutes an "attempt" is a mixed question of law and fact,
depending largely on the circumstances of the particular case. "Attempt" defies a
precise and exact definition. Broadly speaking, all crimes which consist of the
commission of affirmative acts are preceded by some covert or overt conduct which
may be divided into three stages. The first stage exists when the culprit first entertains
the idea or intention to commit an offence. In the second stage, he makes preparations
to commit it. The third stage is reached when the culprit takes deliberate overt steps to
commit the offence. Such overt act or step in order to be 'criminal' need not be the
penultimate act towards the commission of the offence. It is sufficient if such act or
acts were deliberately done, and manifest a clear intention to commit the offence
aimed, being reasonably proximate to the consummation of the offence.
The test for determining whether the acts constitute attempt or preparation is whether
the overt acts already done are such that if the offender changes his mind and does not
proceed further in its progress, the acts already done would be completely harmless.
But where the thing done is such as, if not prevented by any extraneous cause, would
fructify into commission of an offence, it would amount to an attempt to commit that
offence.15. An attempt to commit an offence does not cease to be an attempt merely
because after the attempt is made and before the actual completion of the offence the
offender may be able to prevent its completion by doing some other act in pursuance
of a changed intention.16.
An accused is liable for attempt where his failure to commit an offence is not due to
any act or omission of his own, but to the intervention of some factor independent of
his own volition.17. Where misrepresentations had been made and money obtained
from the persons sought to be cheated by misrepresentations, there is an attempt to
cheat and not merely a preparation for committing that offence.18.
[s 511.4] Distinction between 'preparation' and 'attempt'.—
There is a distinction between 'preparation' and 'attempt'. Attempt begins where
preparation ends. A person commits the offence of attempt to commit a particular
offence when accused (i) intends to commit a particular offence, (ii) he having made
preparation and with the intention to commit an offence, (iii) does an act towards its
commission, such an act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of
that offence but must be an act during the course of committing that offence.19.
1. 'Offence punishable by this Code'.—No criminal liability can be incurred under the
Code by an attempt to do an act, which if done will not be an offence against the
Code.20.
The expression "whoever attempts to commit an offence" in this section can only mean
"whoever intends to do a certain act with the intent or knowledge necessary for the
commission of that offence".21.
[s 511.5] Impossible offence.—
An attempt is possible, even when the offence attempted cannot be committed; as
when a person, intending to pick another person's pocket, thrusts his hand into the
pocket, but finds it empty. That such an act would amount to a criminal attempt
appears from the illustrations to this section. But in doing such an act, the offender's
intention is to commit a complete offence, and his act only falls short of the offence by
reason of an accidental circumstance which has prevented the completion of the
offence. It is possible to attempt to commit an impossible theft and so offend against
the Code because theft is itself an offence against the Code, and may therefore, be
attempted within the meaning of the Code. At the same time it is necessary to show
that the means adopted are apparently suitable for the fulfilment of the design.22. Thus
where a man threatens the life of another with a child's pop gun using a cork as a
projectile23. or tries to pick the pocket of a man who is well beyond the reach of his
hand, no attempt either to commit murder or to steal can be said to have been
committed as the means adopted are impossible of achieving the designed purpose.
Similar would be the case in regard to absolutely impossible acts. Thus where the act
is such that it is incapable of commission, e.g., trying to steal from an empty room or
an empty pocket or trying to kill a person by shooting at a bulge in a bed thinking it to
be the enemy, no criminal attempt can be said to have been committed.24. In the IPC,
1860, however, trying to steal from an empty pocket would still constitute an attempt
as Illustration (b) to section 511, IPC, 1860 specifically says so. Though in England too
this happened to be the law previously25. the position has materially changed after the
decision of the House of Lords in Haughtons case.26. It is felt that the law in India
should be changed on this score at least to bring about a uniformity of approach to this
question of attempt so far sections 307 and 511, IPC, 1860 are concerned especially,
after the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Om Prakash's case,27. has held
that under both these sections the act need not be the last proximate act.
[s 511.6] Attempt to cheat.—
The accused applied to the Patna University for permission to appear at the MA
Examination in English as a private candidate representing that he was a graduate
having obtained his BA degree three years earlier and that he had been teaching in a
certain school. In support of his application, he attached certain certificates purporting
to be from the Headmaster of the School and the Inspector of Schools. The University
authorities gave the accused permission to appear at the examination. Later on, finding
that the certificates were false and that the accused was not a graduate and was not a
teacher, the University authorities withdrew the permission. The Supreme Court held
that the accused was guilty of attempting to cheat and that the moment the accused
dispatched his application to the University, he entered the realm of attempting to
commit the offence of cheating.28. Where the accused made an alteration in his own
affidavit under the honest belief that it was necessary for customs' clearance, the
Supreme Court set aside the conviction under section 420 read with this section.29.
The offence of attempting to cheat may be committed even though the person
attempted to be cheated does not believe in the representations made to him and is
not misled by them but only feigns belief in order to trap the offender.30.
[s 511.7] Outraging Modesty of a Woman and attempt to Rape (sections 354
and 511 read with section 376).—
In between complete rape and attempt to commit rape there is a rare area covered by
section 354 of IPC, 1860, i.e., assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage
her modesty or indecent assault. The dividing line between attempt to commit rape and
indecent assault is not only thin but also is practically invisible. For an offence of
attempt to commit rape, prosecution is required to establish that the act of the accused
went beyond the stage of preparation. In a given case, where the prosecutrix was made
naked and her cries attracted her uncle who came to the spot and then the accused
fled away, it was held that it was not a case of attempt to commit rape but was one
under section 354 of IPC, 1860.31.
[s 511.8] 'Attempt could be a minor offence'.—
It is true that there was no charge under section 376 read with section 511, IPC, 1860.
However, under section 222 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973)
when a person is charged for an offence he may be convicted of an attempt to commit
such offence although the attempt is not separately charged.32.
2. 'Where no express provision is made by this Code'.—The section does not apply to
cases of attempts made punishable by some specific sections of the Code. The
attempts specifically provided for are:—
Section 121, attempt to wage war against the Government of India. Section 124,
attempt wrongfully to restrain the President and other high officials with intent to
induce or compel them to exercise or refrain from exercising any of their lawful powers.
Section 125, attempt to wage war against the Government of any Asiatic Power in
alliance or at peace with the Government of India. Section 130, attempt to rescue State

false. Sections 198, 200, attempt to use as true a certificate or declaration known to be
false in a material point. Section 213, attempt to obtain a gratification to screen an
offender from punishment. Sections 239 and 240, attempt to induce a person to
receive a counterfeit coin. Section 241, attempt to induce a person to receive as

counterfeit. Sections 307 and 308, attempts to commit murder and culpable homicide.
Section 309, attempt to commit suicide. Sections 385, 387 and 389, attempt to put a
person in fear of injury or accusation in order to commit extortion. Section 391,
