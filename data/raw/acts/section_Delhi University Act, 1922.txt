Delhi University Act, 1922
Act 
No. 8 of 1922
1440.
 


Object and Reasons (1)(i)"The University Education Commission, while making certain recommendations in regard to University education generally, also dealt with certain special problems relating to the Central Universities at Rcnares, Aligarh and  Delhi. These recommendations were generally approved by the Central Advisory Board of Iducation at their meeting in April, 1950. While the amendments necessitated by the acceptance of these recommendations could be given effect  to during the last session of Parliament with respect to the Aligarh Muslim University Act and the Benares Hindu  University Act. time did not permit of similar amendments being carried out with respect to the Delhi University Act, 1922.
The amendments contained in the present Bill are identical with those accepted by Parliament in regard to the  tknares Hindu University Act and the Aligarh Muslim University Act after detailed consideration by a Select Committee  and full discussion in Parliament. The main feature of this Bill, as in the case of the other two Bills, are that religious  instruction is to he given only to those who wish to receive it as required by Article 28 (3) of the Constitution, and than  the President of India is to be the Visitor of the University. Power is assumed for a temporary period, as in the case of  the other two Bills, to make modifications in the Statutes so as to bring them into accord with the principal Act as now amended and the recommendations of the University Education Commission. The other amendments proposed do not  call for any detailed comments." - Gazette of India, 1952. Pt. II. Section 2, p. 21.
(ii)The question of reorganisation of the Delhi University has been under consideration for quite some time. On  the request of the Ministry of Education the University Grants Commission constituted a Committee under the  chairmanship of the Vice-Chancellor of the Delhi University to go into the administ rat ive and organisational difficulties  (including University College relationship) of the University. The Committee submitted its Report and its recommendations are as follows:
(a) The Act should be amended to give power to the University to declare certain colleges as autonomous colleges.
(b) The Colleges may he grouped together into two or three groups and a College Council may be appointed to look after each group of colleges. A College Council should have the same powers as the Executive Council and should be headed by a full-time Chairman, appointed by the Visitor on the recommendation of the Vice-Chancellor or the Executive Council.
2. The University Grants Commission while considering the Report of the Committee had strongly supported the  concept of autonomous colleges and decent ralisa ion of administration.
3. After consideration of the recommendations of the said Committee and the views of the Vice-Chancellor, the  Delhi University Act was amended by an Ordinance so that the University may have the following powers before the  commencement of the next academic session, namely
(a)
to declare colleges conducting courses of study in the Faculties of Medicine, Technology, Music and Fine Arts as autonomous colleges:
(b) to empower the University to set up one or more College Councils:
(c) empower the Executive Council of the University, instead of the Court, to make new or additional Statutes or  amend the existing statutes with the approval of the Visitor of the University.
4. The Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance - S.O.R. Gazette of India, 3-8-72., Pt. II., Section 2., Ext., p. 653.
Amendment Act 43 of 2002.- Sub-section (2) of section 5 of the Delhi University Act, 1922 (
8 of 1922
), a central legislation (enacted by the Indian Legislature) prohibits the affiliation of any educational institution or college with any University other than the Delhi University within the limits of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, unless it is specifically permitted by an order of the Central Government. The Delhi University already has a large number of institutions and colleges affiliated with it and may not be in a position to take on the continuous additional burden of new institutions and colleges as well as increasing student population.
2. In order to facilitate the affiliation of institutions and colleges located in the National Capital Territory of Delhi with the Indraprastha Vishwavidyalaya, an amendment is required in sub-section (2) of section 5 of the Delhi University Act, 1922.
