Limit to imprisonment for non-payment of fine, when imprisonment and
fine awardable.
The term for which the Court directs the offender to be imprisoned in default of
payment of a fine shall not exceed one-fourth of the term of imprisonment which is
the maximum fixed for the offence, if the offence be punishable with imprisonment as
well as fine.
COMMENTâ€”
This section applies to all cases where the offence is 'punishable with imprisonment as
well as fine,' i.e., cases where fine and imprisonment can be awarded, and also those
where the punishment may be either fine or imprisonment, but not both. The only cases
that it does not apply to are those dealt with in section 67 where fine only can be
awarded.204. Section 33 (now 30) of the Cr PC, 1973 acts as a corollary to this section.
Thus under section 65, IPC, 1860 the imprisonment in default of fine cannot exceed
one-fourth of the maximum term of imprisonment that can be awarded for the offence.
Thus, where the High Court altered the conviction of the appellant to one under section
419 read with section 109 IPC, from a conviction recorded by the trial Court under
sections 420/511, 467, 468 and 471 read with section 120B IPC, and awarded a
sentence of two years' rigorous imprisonment while maintaining the fine of Rs. 3,000
and by implication the default imprisonment of two years as awarded by the trial Court,
it was held that, though the trial Court's order regarding two years' imprisonment in
default of payment of fine was quite in order in view of the fact that the five offences
for which the trial Court recorded a conviction were each punishable with seven years'
imprisonment and the fine of Rs. 3,000 was only a part of the cumulative sentence for
the commission of those five offences, yet the sentence of three years' imprisonment
in default of payment of fine became illegal the moment the High Court altered the
conviction to one under section 419 read with section 109 IPC, as under these sections
the accused could be sentenced to a maximum of three years' imprisonment and,
therefore, the default imprisonment could under no circumstance exceed nine months,
that is, one-fourth of the maximum sentence of three years that could be awarded
under section 419, IPC.205. While a Magistrate's powers are specifically limited by
section 33(old) Cr PC they must also be exercised so as not to contravene section 65
IPC.206. Section 326, IPC is punishable with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment
of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable
to fine. However, because of section 29(2), Cr PC the learned Magistrate, First Class,
cannot impose the maximum amount of imprisonment prescribed by this section; he
also cannot, by resorting to section 65, IPC, award a period of imprisonment, in default
of payment of fine, on the erroneous assumption that he has the power to award the
maximum sentence prescribed by section 326, IPC.207. Section 65 IPC that puts a limit
of imprisonment for default sentence upto one-fourth of the term of imprisonment, the
grievance against higher default sentence, if any, can be only by the accused and not by
the State.208.
