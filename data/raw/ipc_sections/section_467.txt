be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
three years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENTâ€”
Lurking house-trespass or house-breaking is ordinarily punishable under section 453;
but when it is committed at night, this section is applicable. The intent necessary to
prove 'criminal trespass' must be present and the Court must come to a definite
inference as to the intention with which the entry was effected.719. Where the accused
persons, execution creditors, broke open the complainant's door before sunrise with
intent to distrain his property, for which they were convicted on a charge of lurking
house-trespass by night or house-breaking by night, it was held that as they were not
guilty of the offence of criminal trespass the conviction must be quashed.720.
