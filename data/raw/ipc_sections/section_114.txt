harm to innocent person.

causes the apprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot
effectually exercise that right without risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of
private defence extends to the running of that risk.

right of private defence without firing on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of
harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by so
firing he harms any of the children.
