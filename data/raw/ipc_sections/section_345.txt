COMMENT.—
Section 342, IPC, 1860 is not confined to offences against public servants but is a
general section and makes a person who wrongfully restrains another, guilty of the
offence under that section. A wrongful confinement is a wrongful restraint in such a
manner as to prevent that person from proceeding beyond a certain circumscribed
limits. This offence has nothing to do with the investigation or search.949. The essential
ingredients of the offence "wrongful confinement" are that the accused should have
wrongfully confined the complainant and such restraint was to prevent the complainant
from proceeding beyond certain circumscribed limits beyond which he/she has a right
to proceed. The factual scenario clearly establishes commission by the appellant as
well of the offence punishable under section 342 IPC, 1860.950. Confinement need not
necessarily be a confinement where the person is physically held within a certain
circumscribed limit. To support the charge of wrongful confinement, proof of actual
physical obstruction is not essential. It is the condition of the mind of the person
confined, having regard to the circumstances that leads him to reasonably believe that
he was not free to move and that he would be forthwith restrained if he attempted to do
so.951.
Where a man, illegally taken into police custody was beaten by the police and he
committed suicide, the accused police officials were punished under section 342. Case
under sections 352 and 302 was not made out.952. Wife suffered a blow of hammer on
left side below ear and immediately died on spot. Accused husband convicted under
section 342 and 302 IPC, 1860.953. Victim after being arrested was kept in police
station for three days and was not produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours. SHO
cannot be absolved from the charges under section 342.954. In Vadamalai v Syed
Thastha Keer,955. the complainant was allegedly detained and beaten by
appellant/police officials in Police Station but the evidence does not show that he was
kept in police station for four days. Conviction of the appellant by High Court under
sections 323, 342 held not sustainable and liable to be set aside.
The officers who visited the house of the accused for making inquiry under Money
Lenders Act, were not allowed to go out of the house for some time. It was found that
there was no apprehension in their mind about use of force in case they tried to move
out. It was held that no offence under section 342 was made out.956.
