Fine leviable within six years, or during imprisonment. Death not to
discharge property from liability.
The fine, or any part thereof which remains unpaid, may be levied at any time within
six years after the passing of the sentence, and if, under the sentence, the offender be
liable to imprisonment for a longer period than six years, then at any time previous to
the expiration of that period; and the death of the offender does not discharge from
the liability any property which would, after his death, be legally liable for his debts.
COMMENTâ€”
Imprisonment in default of fine does not liberate the offender from his liability to pay
the full amount of fine imposed on him. Such imprisonment is not a discharge or
satisfaction of the fine but is imposed as a punishment for non-payment or contempt
or resistance to the due execution of the sentence. The offender cannot be permitted
to choose whether he will suffer in his person or his property. His person will cease to
be answerable for the fine. Nevertheless, his property will for a time continue to do so.
The bar of six years may save the property of the accused but not his personal arrest.
The liability for any sentence of imprisonment awarded in default of payment of fine
continues after the expiration of six years.218. Any proceeding taken after six years to
recover the fine by sale of immoveable property of the offender is time-barred.219. The
limitation starts from the date of passing of the sentence of conviction by the trial
Court and not the date of dismissal of the appeal or revision preferred by the
accused.220. The property of the accused is liable for the payment of fine even if he has
undergone imprisonment in default of fine and as such even on death of the offender
does not discharge any property which would after his death, be legally liable for his
debts due from him (including liability) to discharge the fine.221.
The expression "levy" in this section means "to seize" for the purpose of collecting the
fine or to enforce execution for a certain sum and not actual realisation.222. Any stay or
suspension obtained from the higher Court has to be excluded in computing the period
of six years' limitation under section 70 IPC.223. Section 70 says that State shall levy
fine within six years from the date of sentence. What is contemplated is that the State
shall commence recovery proceedings within six years; and, need not be completed it
within six years of the sentence. Therefore, once a distress warrant is issued within six
years of the sentence, the plea of limitation is out of bounds for the sentence.224.
