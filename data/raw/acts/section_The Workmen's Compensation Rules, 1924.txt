by the employer, on the ground that since the right to compensation was determined the workmen's wages have increased;

by the workman, on the ground that since the right to compensation was determined his wages have diminished;
(c)
by the workman, on the ground that the employer, having commenced to pay compensation, has ceased to pay the same, notwithstanding the fact that there has been no change in the workman's condition such as to warrant such cessation;
(d)
either by the employer, or by the workman, on the ground that the determination of the rate of compensation for the time being in force was obtained by fraud or undue influence or other improper means;
(e)
either by the employer or by the workman, on the ground that in the determination of compensation there is a mistake or error apparent on the face of the record.
4.
 Procedure on application for review .-If, on examining an application for review by an employer in which the reduction or discontinuance of half-monthly payments is sought it appears to the Commissioner that there is reasonable ground for believing that the employer has a right to such reduction or discontinuance, he may at any time issue an order withholding the half-monthly payments in whole or in part pending his decision on the application.
5.
 Procedure on application for commutation .-(1) Where application is made to the Commissioner under section 7 for the redemption of a right to receive half-monthly payments by the payment of a lump sum, the Commissioner shall form an estimate of the probable duration of the disablement, and shall award a sum equivalent to the total of the half-monthly payments which would be payable for the period during which he estimates that the disablement will continue, less one-half per cent of that total for each month comprised in that period:


Provided that fractions of a rupee included in the sum so computed shall be disregarded.

(b)
any dependant to whom such notice has been given and who fails to appear and to join in the application on the date specified in the notice shall not be permitted thereafter to claim that the employer is liable to deposit compensation unless he satisfies the Commissioner that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the case was called on for hearing.
