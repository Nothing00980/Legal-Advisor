"Reason to believe.".
A person is said to have "reason to believe" a thing, if he has sufficient cause to
believe that thing but not otherwise.
COMMENTâ€”
"Reason to believe" is another facet of the state of mind. It is not the same thing as
"suspicion" or "doubt" and mere seeing also cannot be equated to believing. It is a
higher level of state of mind. It means that a person must have reason to believe if the
circumstances are such that a reasonable man would, by probable reasoning, conclude
or infer regarding the nature of the thing concerned.137. The word "believe" is a very
much stronger word than "suspect" and that it involves the necessity of showing that
the circumstances were such that a reasonable man must have felt convinced in his
mind that the note with which he was dealing was a forged one and that it was not
sufficient to show that the accused was careless or he had reason to suspect or that he
did not make sufficient enquiry to ascertain the fact.138. A person can be supposed to
know something where there is a direct appeal to his senses. Suspicion or doubt
cannot be raised to the level of "reason to believe."139. "Reason to believe" in section 42
of NDPS Act is a question of fact and depends upon the facts and circumstances of
each case.140.
