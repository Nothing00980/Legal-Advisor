Sentence may be (in certain cases of imprisonment) wholly or partly
rigorous or simple.
In every case in which an offender is punishable with imprisonment which may be of
either description, it shall be competent to the Court which sentences such offender
to direct in the sentence that such imprisonment shall be wholly rigorous, or that such
imprisonment shall be wholly simple, or that any part of such imprisonment shall be
rigorous and the rest simple.
COMMENTâ€”
Life imprisonment means rigorous imprisonment for life.184. A distinction between
'imprisonment for life' and 'imprisonment for a term' has been maintained in the Indian
Penal Code in several of its provisions. Second, by its very terms section 60 is
applicable to a case where 'an offender is punishable with imprisonment which may be
of either description' and it is only in such case that it is competent for the Court to
direct that 'such imprisonment shall be either wholly rigorous or wholly simple or that
any part of such imprisonment shall be rigorous and the rest simple'. And it is clear that
whenever an offender is punishable with 'imprisonment for life' he is not punishable
with 'imprisonment which may be of either description', in other words section 60
would be inapplicable. The position in law as regards the nature of punishment
involved in a sentence of imprisonment for life is well settled and the sentence of
imprisonment for life has to be equated to rigorous imprisonment for life.185.
