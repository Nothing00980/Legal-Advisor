Commutation of sentence of death.
In every case in which sentence of death shall have been passed, 127.[the appropriate
Government] may, without the consent of the offender, commute the punishment for
any other punishment provided by this Code.
COMMENT—
The law governing suspension, remission and commutation of sentence is both
statutory and constitutional.128. The stage for the exercise of this power generally
speaking is post-judicial, i.e., after the judicial process has come to an end. After the
judicial function ends, the executive function of giving effect to the judicial verdict
commences. Constitutional power under Article 72/161 would override the statutory
power contained in sections 432 and 433 and the limitation of section 433A of the
Code as well as the power conferred by sections 54 and 55, IPC, 1860.129. No convict
has a fundamental right of remission or shortening of sentence. The State in exercise
of its executive power of remission must consider each individual case keeping in view
the relevant factors. The power of the State to issue general instructions, so that no
discrimination is made, is also permissible in law.130. Exercise of executive clemency is
a matter of discretion and yet subject to certain standards. It is not a matter of
privilege.131. A right to be considered for remission, keeping in view the constitutional
safeguards of a convict under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India, must be
held to be a legal one. Such a legal right emanates from not only the Prisons Act but
also from the Rules framed thereunder.132. The power of remission vested in the
Government under section 433A Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973) is not
in conflict with Articles 72 and 162 of the Constitution.133. Granting of pardon is in no
sense an overturning of a judgment of conviction, but rather it is an executive action
that mitigates or sets aside the punishment for a crime. It eliminates the effect of
conviction without addressing the defendant's guilt or innocence.134. It is open to the
President in the exercise of the power vested in him by Article 72 of the Constitution to
scrutinize the evidence on the record of the criminal case and come to a different
conclusion from that recorded by the Court in regard to the guilt of, and sentence
imposed on, the accused.135.
[s 54.1] Delay in Execution whether entitle commutation of Death sentence to
Life Imprisonment.—
In TV Vatheeswaran's case, AIR 1983 SC 361 [LNIND 1983 SC 43] : 1983 SCR (2) 348136.
a two-Judge Bench of SC considered whether the accused, who was convicted for an
offence of murder and sentenced to death, kept in solitary confinement for about eight
years was entitled to commutation of death sentence. It was held that delay exceeding
two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to
entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the
quashing of the sentence of death.137. But a three-Judge in Sher Singh v State of
Punjab,138. held that though prolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence is
unquestionably an important consideration for determining whether the sentence
should be allowed to be commuted, no hard and fast rule that "delay exceeding two
years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle
the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of
the sentence of death" can be laid down as has been done in Vatheeswaran Javed
Ahmed v State of Maharashtra,139. re-iterated the proposition laid down in Vatheeswaran
(supra) case and doubted the competence of the three-Judge Bench to overrule the
Vatheeswaran Case. The conflicting views are finally settled by the Constitution Bench
in Triveni Ben v State of Gujarat.140. It overruled Vatheeswaran (supra) holding that
undue long delay in execution of the sentence of death will entitle the condemned
person to approach this Court under Article 32 but the Court will only examine the
nature of delay caused and circumstances that ensued after sentence was finally
confirmed by the judicial process and will have no jurisdiction to reopen the
conclusions reached by the Court while finally maintaining the sentence of death.
Court, however, may consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all
circumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of sentence should be
carried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life. No fixed period of delay
could be held to make the sentence of death inexecutable and to this extent the
decision in Vatheeswaran case cannot be said to lay down the correct law. In Madhu
Mehta v UOI,141.,142. Supreme Court commuted the death sentence on the ground that
the mercy petition was pending for eight years after disposal of the criminal appeal by
Supreme Court.
[s 54.1.1] Devender Singh Bhullar and Mahendra Das.—
In Devender Pal Singh Bhullar v State of NCT of Delhi,143. the convict appealed to the
President for clemency in 2003. The President, after a lapse of over eight years,
dismissed his mercy plea in 2011. Bhullar had sought commutation of his death
penalty to life sentence by the Supreme Court on the ground that there was inordinate
delay by the President over his plea for clemency. A two-Judge Bench144. by order
dated 12 April 2013 dismissed his plea, by holding that the rule enunciated in Sher
Singh's case (supra), Triveniben's case (supra) and some other judgments that long
delay may be one of the grounds for commutation of the sentence of death into life
imprisonment cannot be invoked in cases where a person is convicted for offence
under TADA or similar statutes. Two weeks later in Mahendra Nath Das v UOI,145. the
same Bench held that the convict's death sentence could be commuted to life
imprisonment because much of the inordinate delay of 12 years in the rejection of his
mercy petition by the President was unexplained, and therefore, inexcusable.
[s 54.2] Modification of death sentence to a particular period with the further
direction that the convict must not be released from prison for the rest of his
life or before actually serving out the term.—
It was in Swamy Shraddananda (2) v State of Karnataka,146. the three-Judge Bench held
that there is a good and strong basis for the Court to substitute a death sentence by life
imprisonment or by a term in excess of 14 years and further to direct that the convict
must not be released from the prison for the rest of his life or for the actual term as
specified in the order, as the case may be. But a two-Judge Bench in Sangeet v State of
Haryana147. in which it was held that:
a reading of some recent decisions delivered by this Court seems to suggest that the
remission power of the appropriate Government has effectively been nullified by awarding
sentences of 20 years, 25 years and in some cases without any remission. Is this
permissible? Can this Court (or any Court for that matter) restrain the appropriate
Government from granting remission of a sentence to a convict? What this Court has done
in Swamy Shraddananda and several other cases, by giving a sentence in a capital offence
of 20 years or 30 years imprisonment without remission, is to effectively injunct the
appropriate Government from exercising its power of remission for the specified period. In
our opinion, this issue needs further and greater discussion, but as at present advised, we
are of the opinion that this is not permissible. The appropriate Government cannot be told
that it is prohibited from granting remission of a sentence. Similarly, a convict cannot be
told that he cannot apply for a remission in his sentence, whatever the reason. In this case,
though the Division Bench raised a doubt about the decision of a three-Judge Bench in
Swamy Shraddananda (supra), yet the same has not been referred to a larger Bench.
In Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jan v State of Rajasthan,148. another two-Judge Bench re-
iterated the position held in Swamy Shraddananda (supra) by holding that the
observations in Sangeet (supra) are not warranted. In Gurvail Singh @ Gala v State of
Punjab,149. another two Judge also termed the remarks in Sangeet (supra) were
'unwarranted' and opined that if the two-Judge Bench was of the opinion that earlier
judgments, even of a larger Bench were not justified, the Bench ought to have referred
the matter to the larger Bench.
