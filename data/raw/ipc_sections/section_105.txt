Right of private defence of the body and of property.
Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section 99, to defend
—
First.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting
the human body;
Secondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other
person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft,
robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft,
robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.
COMMENT.—
This section broadly specifies the offences against which the right of private defence
can be exercised. Section 99 provides the limitations. These two sections combined
together lay down the principles of the right of private defence.
The first clause of this section provides for the defence of body against any offence
affecting the human body. The second provides for the defence of property against an
act which amounts to the commission of certain offences.
There is no obligation upon a person entitled to exercise the right of private defence
and to defend his person or property, to retire merely because his assailant threatens
him with violence.337.
Explaining the genesis of the rule, the Supreme Court has observed:338.
"It is important to bear in mind that self-preservation of one's life is the necessary
concomitant of the right of life enshrined in Art. 21 of the Constitution of India, fundamental
in nature, sacred, precious and inviolable. The importance and validity of the duty and right
to self-preservation has a species in the right of self-defence in criminal law. Centuries ago
thinkers of this great land conceived of such right and recognised it."
[s 97.1] Aggressor has no right of private defence.—
The right to defend does not include a right to launch an offensive or aggression.339.
The right of private defence does not arise where the accused were the aggressors and
the question of exceeding such right also does not arise.340. The Supreme Court
added, in this case, that the right of self-defence arises when there is unexpected
apprehension and one is taken unawares, or the accused happens to kill accidentally
while using reasonable force private defence can be used to ward off unlawful force, or
to prevent it, to avoid unlawful detention and to escape from such detention.341.
When the father of the accused was trying to forcibly remove the gate of the thrashing
ground of the deceased which was situated on the land of the deceased, his act
amounted to an offence of 'mischief'. And, if the deceased while protecting his own
property assaulted the father of the accused with a lathi, and the accused killed him in
return, the accused could not claim the right of private defence of body of his
father.342. In another case of the same kind the father of the accused was trying to pull
out the gate of the deceased thrashing mill and on the deceased assaulting him in
protection, the accused struck him dead. The right of private defence was not available
in the circumstances.343. Where the parties went away from the property over which
they were fighting, the death caused at that shifted place was not a justifiable exercise
of the right of private defence.344. Where the accused succeeded in establishing their
right to the property in dispute through the Court and then went to the field with a view
to ask the other party to vacate the premises, it was held that it by itself did not render
them to be aggressors for the purpose of denying them the benefit of right of self-
defence.345.
Number of injuries is not always the safe criterion for determining who the aggressor
is. The fact of injuries on the body of the accused does not by itself create the
presumption that the accused was entitled to the right of private defence.346.
[s 97.2] Unlawful assembly.—
So long as an assembly of persons is acting in exercise of the right of private defence it
cannot be an unlawful assembly. An assembly though lawful to begin with, may in the
course of events become unlawful. So long as the accused persons were acting in
exercise of right of private defence, their object was not unlawful and so there was no
unlawful assembly but once they exceeded the right, the assembly ceased to be lawful
and became an unlawful assembly. There too only such of the members of the
assembly who shared the object of doing anything in excess of the exercise of right of
private defence, alone would be liable to be punished for the acts committed in
prosecution of the common object or for their individual unlawful acts.347.
[s 97.3] Right of private defence to be pleaded.—
In a Supreme Court case it is stated,
It is well settled that even if an accused does not plead self-defence, it is open to the Court
to consider such a plea if the same arises from materials on record.348.
But if no plea was entered on behalf of the accused and there were also no
circumstances to show that the accused had probably the right of private defence,
such a right could not be presumed on behalf of the accused on mere conjectures and
surmises.349. A mere bald assertion without any evidence of facts and circumstances
does not make out a case of private defence.350. The accused can, however, make out
his plea by mere preponderance of probabilities from materials already on record and
need not prove it to the hilt.351. Where by preponderance of probabilities the plea of
private defence of the accused is plausible, benefit should be extended to the
accused.352. Failure on the part of the prosecution to prove that the injuries on the
person of the accused were not caused in self-defence, makes the defence of the
accused probable and he is entitled to its benefit because he has not to prove his
defence beyond reasonable doubt.353. Where the accused set up the plea of self-
defence only during trial and not during investigation, it was held that this was not a
ground for rejecting the plea.354. The accused on the observation of the High Court
that the deceased was stabbed by the appellant, not in pursuance of any pre-planned
attack, but being under the impression that the deceased was coming to attack him.
The said observation cannot be read out of context to make out a case that the
accused acted in self-defence. Such a plea is neither put forth in the statement under
section 313 nor brought out in the cross examination of any of the prosecution
witnesses.355. It is true that the right of private defence need not specifically be taken
and in the event the Court on the basis of the materials on record is in a position to
come to such a conclusion, despite some other plea having been raised, that such a
case had been made out, it may act thereupon.356.
[s 97.4] CASES.—Defence of person.—
Under circumstances which might have induced the belief that a man was cutting the
throat of his wife, their son shot and killed his father. It was held that if the son had
reasonable ground for believing and honestly believed that his act was necessary for
the defence of his mother, the homicide was excusable.357. Where a girl was being
sexually molested and her father hit the assailant resulting in consequential death, it
was held that the father was entitled to the right of private defence irrespective of the
fact whether the affair was with or without consent because of the girl being a
minor.358. Where a man found his wife in compromising position with a person who
sprang at the husband and caused him multiple injuries, some of them grievous, the
husband thereafter gave a chopper blow resulting in the death of that person, it was
held that the husband had not exceeded his right of private defence and was entitled to
acquittal.359. Where the father of the accused was being given lathi blows by the
complainant party, the accused fired from the licensed gun of his father to defend his
father, it was held that he had acted in the exercise of the right of private defence
whether the injuries caused to his father were simple or grievous.360. Trespassers on
the property of another cannot get any benefit of right of private defence if they are
attacked by the person in possession of the property.361. However no one including the
true owner has a right to dispossess the trespasser by force if the trespasser is in
settled possession of the land and in such a case unless he is evicted in due course of
law, he is entitled to defend his possession even against the rightful owner. Such
possession of the trespasser must extend over a sufficiently long period and
acquiesced in by the true owner.362. Though law permits even a trespasser in settled
possession to defend his possession but, it does not permit a person to take the law in
his own hand to take forcible possession merely because he has obtained a favourable
order under section 145 Cr PC, 1973. Such a person cannot claim private defence.363.
Settled possession means such clear and effective physical possession that under the
criminal law he, even if he is a trespasser, gets the right to defend his possession of the
property against an attack even by the true owner.364. If no party is proved to be in
settled possession, the question of exercise of right of private defence does not
arise.365. Where the accused were in possession of the property and had grown the
paddy, they were entitled to defend their possession by using reasonable force which in
the instant case went up to causing of death as the party in possession was attacked
and grievous blows were given to them.366. Where the prosecution party attacked the
accused, his brothers and others with sharp edged weapons and lathis and when they
tried to enter the latter's house, the accused fired at the crowd resulting in the death of
a man and injuries to others, it was held that the accused had acted only in the exercise
of the right of private defence and he was entitled to complete acquittal.367. Where the
accused was fired at to dispel his party from attempting to rescue their friend from
illegal police detention and an informer accompanying the police who tried to prevent
them from snatching the police gun received fatal injuries, it was held that they were
entitled to the right of private defence.368. Where a fatal injury was caused in
consequence of hot exchange of words, the right of private defence was held to be not
available.369. The Supreme Court has suggested that the number and nature of injuries
sustained by the accused and the deceased in any case, may furnish good evidence to
consider whether the accused was acting in private defence and, if so, whether he had
exceeded his right. In the state of the evidence on record in that case and the number
of injuries suffered by the accused, the Court did not accede to the contention that the
right was not properly exercised.370.
[s 97.5] Defence of another person.—
The right of private defence need not necessarily be exercised for the defence of one's
own person; it can be exercised for the defence of the person of another one.371.
[s 97.6] Defence of property.—
Every person in possession of land is entitled to defend his possession against anyone
who tries to eject him by force,372. or to steal from it;373. or to do an act which will have
the effect of causing injury to it, e.g., cutting of a bund.374. Even if a trespass has been
committed, in certain situations, right of private defence can be used to eject the
trespassers.375. Where the accused had no right, title, interest or possession of the
land in issue, right of private defence of property did not vest in him.376.
Where the complainant party was about 300 feet away from the disputed land and it
was further found that the accused had not shown that there was any injury on the
person of the accused, it was held that no right of private defence arose in favour of the
accused. 377.
[s 97.7] Open space.—
Though private defence is available in respect of criminal trespass or mischief as
against the property owned by himself or of any other person, but criminal trespass is
not enumerated as one of the offences under section 103 IPC, 1860. Therefore, the
right of private defence of property will not extend to the causing of death of the
person who committed such acts, if the act of trespass is in respect of an open land.
Only a house-trespass committed under such circumstances as may reasonably cause
apprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence is enumerated as
one of the offences under section 103.378. But in another judgment Supreme Court
held that there is no law that right of self-defence cannot be exercised in relation to a
dispute over an open space.379. Where the trespasser was in settled possession of the
field in question, and the party who claimed ownership started ploughing the field, it
was held that the trespasser (accused) had the right of private defence of his
possession over property and offer resistance, but that he exceeded that right in
causing death. His act fell under exception 2 to section 300 and punishable under
section 304, Part I.380. Where a goat of the accused entered the field of another and he
was trying to take it way, the other struck him with lathi blows and also his companion
who came to his rescue. Only then the accused retaliated with lathi blows resulting in
death. Supreme Court upheld the acquittal.381. The right is subject to restrictions
imposed by section 99, the accused party was in possession of the land, the deceased
party wanted to enter into possession forcibly. One of the aggressors was killed and
another grievously hurt. The accused that caused the death was held to be guilty of
exceeding the right of private defence. The acquittal of the person who caused
grievous hurt with a spear was held to be not proper. He was liable to be convicted
under section 326.382. Accused having not been in settled possession had no right to
self-defence to defend the possession of the property.383. Occurrence took place on
the land which was in possession of deceased. Accused cannot take the plea of private
defence.384. No right of private defence of property to a person who was not in
possession of the property.385.
Where the accused to a certain stage acted in defence of their property but exceeded it
in breaking into the room of their victim, striking him with a lathi blow and also his wife
and daughter who were also there in the room, the victim subsequently dying, their
conviction was shifted from under section 302 to that under section 304 Part 1.386.
The right of private defence of property (share in land) was held to have been exceeded
when the deceased's side being armed with lathis only, the accused party fired at them
with a gun, killing one and injuring others. The right of private defence was not available
to them.387.
Where the finding of the Courts below was that the accused and his companions were
aggressors because they assaulted the victim and his children when they came out to
protest against cutting of their by the accused, it was held that the benefit of the right
of private defence was not available to the accused.388.
Defence of property may create circumstances ripening into the right of defence of
person. This is so because even in defending property, the attack and counter-attack is
likely to be on person. This was the situation in a case in which the accused while
defending land over which they had possession; they became the victim of attack on
person with sharp cutting weapons. It became their right to repel the danger of
grievous hurt or even death and to use for that purpose reasonably appropriate force.
Their right extended to cause death of the aggressors if that could be the only way of
saving themselves.389.
[s 97.8] CASES.—Exceeding private defence.—
The father of the accused was attacked by the deceased with a lathi and suffered a
simple injury on his head, whereupon the accused in order to protect his father
administered a fatal blow on the chest of the deceased with a ballam. It was held that
though the accused had the right of private defence, he had obviously exceeded it and
was, therefore, liable under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860.390. A somewhat contrary view
has, however, been taken by the Supreme Court in a later case where too the accused
had exercised his right of private defence against a lathi blow on the head. Thus, in Deo
Narain's case it has been held that the accused was justified in using his spear though
the other party had aimed only a lathi blow on the head, which being a vulnerable part
even a lathi blow could prove dangerous.391. It thus, appears that the part of the body
against which the attack is directed is more important than the weapon used. Where
the deceased attacked the accused with a stick and the accused retaliated by stabbing
the former to death his offence fell under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860, as he had
exceeded the right of private defence.392. Evidence on record showed that accused had
received many injuries on his person, and exercised right of private defence of person
in good faith. He had sustained four injuries on various parts of his body including on
vital parts, thus, case would be covered by Exception 2 to section 300 of IPC, 1860. The
nature of weapon used, circumstances in which incident took place, injuries on body of
accused as well as deceased, showed that there was no premeditation. He had
exercised his right of self-defence but having regard to the injuries inflicted by him on
deceased, he exceeded same.393. Where the accused, a person with only one hand was
attacked with a bamboo and sustained several injuries and then to ward off further
attack gave only one blow with a pen-knife on the aggressor which unfortunately fell on
a vital part resulting in his death, it could not be said that he had exceeded his right of
private defence. For the accused it was a case of life or death struggle and his case,
therefore, squarely fell within the ambit of clauses (1) and (2) of section 100, IPC, 1860,
and he could not be held guilty of any offence.394. In a sudden group clash over a
house both sides received injuries and one person was killed. There was no prior
enmity between two groups and the whole incident developed suddenly. Accused
persons received quite a number of injuries, some on vital parts, and the prosecution
was not able to explain those injuries. It was held that the accused could not be said to
have exceeded the right of private defence. Their conviction was set aside.395. Two
armed bullies of a locality raided a flat in a drunken state and demanded money from
the inmates with the use of force. This amounted to the crime of extortion giving the
inmates the right to defend themselves against the raiders. Both the raiders met their
death in the process of the ensuing scuffle, it being not known nor capable of being
ascertained who played what roll in the combat. The Supreme Court held that it could
not be said of any one of them that he exceeded the right of private defence. Hence,
they could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34.396. The accused
using his licenced gun fired only one shot after receiving a severe blow on his head
fracturing his skull. It was held that he did not exceed his right of self-defence.397. A
person had a lurking suspicion about illicit relations between his elder brother's wife
and the accused and he caught hold of the accused when the latter visited their house
to meet her. The accused inflicted knife injuries on him to extricate himself but did not
inflict any further injury after freeing himself. It was held that the accused had not
exceeded the right of private defence and was not guilty under section 307 for
attempted murder.398. Where the accused fired a single gunshot at the deceased party
to save his uncle who had received serious injuries in the attack made by the deceased
party, the gun shot unfortunately proved fatal, the accused could not be said to have
exceeded his right of self- defence.399. Where in a murder case over obstruction of
water course, the victim assaulted the accused twice and injured him whereupon the
accused inflicted a blow on him which proved fatal, the accused could not be said to
have exceeded his right of private defence.400.
A police party was looking for the accused to affect their arrest. The complainant party
was helping the police. On being located, the accused party opened fire. The police
withdrew after receiving injuries. Two members of the complainant party were killed.
Even a runaway complainant was shot down. This showed that the attack continued
even when all danger to the accused party had ceased. Thus, they exceeded the right of
private defence. Conviction for murder was upheld.401.
Where the death occurred due to the firing resorted to as part of the self-defence, the
same would amount to 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder', which was
committed without any pre-meditation in a sudden fight, in the heat of passion and
upon a sudden quarrel and that the offender could not be said to have taken undue
advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner, which would normally fall under
Exception 4 of section 300 IPC, 1860.402.
[s 97.9] Burden on accused to probablise his defence.—
It is for the accused to establish the plea of private defence. He is not required to prove
it beyond reasonable doubt. The Court has only to examine probabilities in appreciating
the plea. In the present case, the accused had miserably failed to establish or even to
probablise his defence. The deceased persons had merely asked them why they had
cut the mature crop, when they became the victim of attack. They were unarmed.403.
The accused need not take the plea of private defence explicitly. He can succeed in his
plea if he is able to bring out from the evidence of the prosecution witness or other
evidence of the prosecution witness or other evidence that the apparent criminal act
was committed by him in exercise of private defence. The burden on the accused is not
as onerous as that which lies on the prosecution. While the prosecution is required to
prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused can discharge his onus by
establishing preponderance of probabilities.404.
