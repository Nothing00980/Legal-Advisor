COMMENTâ€”
This section punishes persons who refuse to produce documents which they are
legally bound to produce before a public servant. From reading of section 345 of the Cr
PC, 1973, it is clear that offences under sections 175, 178, 179, 180 or 228 would
constitute contempt, only if they are committed in the view or presence of the Court.
This would also show that offences under sections 175, 178, 179, 180 or 228 per se do
not amount to contempt. They are contempt only if they are committed "in the view or
presence of the Court"; otherwise they remain offences under the IPC, 1860
simpliciter.32.

29. Subs. by Act 21 of 2000, section 91 and Sch. I, for "document" (w.e.f. 17-10-2000).
30. Subs. by Act 21 of 2000, section 91 and Sch. I, for "document" (w.e.f. 17-10-2000).
