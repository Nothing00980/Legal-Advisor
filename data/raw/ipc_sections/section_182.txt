servant in the exercise of the legal powers of such public servant, shall be punished
with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine
which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.
COMMENT.—
Refusing to answer questions.—The offence under this section consists in the refusal
to answer a question which is relevant to the subject concerning which the public
servant is authorised to inquire, or which at least touches that subject. Under sections
121–132 of the Indian Evidence Act a witness is exempted from answering certain
questions. If a person gives false answers, then he will be guilty under section 193 and
not under this section.
Refusing to answer the question of a police-officer investigating a case under section
161 of the Criminal Procedure Code is not an offence under this section.52. This
section also applies to the accused as the words used in section 161(1) Cr PC, 1973,
are "any person acquainted with facts and circumstances of the case". Thus, the
accused too is bound to answer a question put by a police-officer in course of his
examination. However, the answer to a question has a tendency to incriminate him; he
can claim protection under Article 20(3) of the Constitution and refuse to answer. Of
course, it is a matter which has to be ultimately decided by the Court.53.
The matter is entirely different so far the officers of the Railway Protection Force are
concerned first, they are not police-officers54. and second, the enquiry conducted by
them under sections 8 and 9 of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966
is not a police investigation but should be deemed to be a judicial proceeding.55.
Section 9 of this special Act specifically lays down that during such enquiry by an RPF
officer, persons summoned have to obey summons and state the truth and, therefore,
by refusing to answer, such persons would make themselves liable under section 179,
IPC, 1860. The question of invoking Article 20(3) of the Constitution does not arise in
such a case, as till the complaint is filed under section 190(1)(a), Cr PC, 1973 by the
RPF officer, a person cannot be regarded as "accused of an offence" within the
meaning of Article 20(3) of the Constitution.56.
