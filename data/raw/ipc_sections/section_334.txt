COMMENT.â€”
This section is similar to the preceding section except that the hurt caused under it
should be 'grievous'. Sections 330 and 331 of the IPC, 1860 provide punishment to one
who voluntarily causes hurt or grievous hurt as the case may be to extort the
confession or any information which may lead to the detection of an offence or
misconduct, thus, the Constitution as well as the statutory procedural law and law of
Evidence condemn the conduct of any official in extorting a confession or information
under compulsion by using any third degree methods.867. The diabolic recurrence of
police torture resulting in a terrible scare in the minds of common citizens that their
lives and liberty are under a new and unwarranted peril because guardians of law
destroy the human rights by custodial violence and torture and invariably resulting in
death. The vulnerability of human rights assumes a significance when functionaries of
the State whose paramount duty is to protect the citizens and not to commit gruesome
offences against them, in reality, such functionaries perpetrate them.868.

caused not even softening of police's attitude towards the inhuman approach in dealing with
persons in custody.
