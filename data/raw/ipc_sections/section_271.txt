Public nuisance.
A person is guilty of a public nuisance, who does any act, or is guilty of an illegal
omission, which causes any common injury, danger, or annoyance to the public or to
the people in general who dwell or occupy property in the vicinity or which must
necessarily cause injury, obstruction, danger, or annoyance to persons who may have
occasion to use any public right.
A common nuisance is not excused on the ground that it causes some convenience or
advantage.
COMMENT.—
Nuisance is an inconvenience that materially interferes with the ordinary physical
comfort of human existence. It may be public or private nuisance. As defined in section
268 Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) public nuisance is an offence against public
either by doing a thing which tends to the annoyance of the whole community in
general or by neglect to do anything which the common good requires. On the
alternative it causes injury, obstruction, danger or annoyance to persons who may have
occasion to use public right. It is the quantum of annoyance or discomfort in contra
distinction to private nuisance which affects an individual is the decisive factor.1.
Nuisance is of two kinds: (1) public and (2) private.
(1) Public nuisance or common nuisance is an offence against the public either by
doing a thing, which tends to the annoyance of the whole community in general, or by
neglecting to do anything that the common good requires. It is an act affecting the
public at large, or some considerable portion of them and it must interfere with rights,
which members of the community might otherwise enjoy.
It is not a sine qua non that the annoyance should injuriously affect every member of
the public within its range of operation. It is sufficient that it should affect people in
general who dwell in the vicinity.2.
As to when an individual can bring a civil action in respect of a public nuisance, see the
authors' Law of Torts, 19th Edn, chapter XXI.
(2) Private nuisance is defined to be anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the
lands, tenements or hereditaments of another, and not amounting to trespass. It is an
act affecting some particular individual or individuals as distinguished from the public
at large. It is in the quantum of annoyance that private nuisance differs from public. It
cannot be the subject of an indictment, but may be the ground of a civil action for
damages or an injunction or both.3.
[s 268.1] Liability of owner.—
Where the use of premises gives rise to a public nuisance it is generally the occupier
for the time being who is liable for it, and not the absent proprietor.4.
[s 268.2] Civil Remedy.—
'Private nuisance' affects some individuals as distinguished from the public at large.
The remedies are of two kinds–civil and criminal. The remedies under the civil law are
of two kinds. One is under section 91 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Under it, a
suit lies and the plaintiffs need not prove that they have sustained any special damage.
The second remedy is a suit by a private individual for a special damage suffered by
him.5.
[s 268.3] Criminal remedy.—
There are three remedies under the criminal law. The first relates to the prosecution
under Chapter XIV of IPC, 1860. The second provides for summary proceedings under
sections 133–144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973) and the third
relates to remedies under special or local laws. Sub-sections (2) of section 133 of Cr
PC, 1973 postulates that no order duly made by a Magistrate under this section shall be
called in question in any civil court. The provisions of Chapter X of the Cr PC, 1973
should be so worked as not to become themselves, a nuisance to the community at
large. A lawful and necessary trade ought not to be interfered with unless it is proved to
be injurious to the health or physical comfort of the community.6.
[s 268.4] Noise.—
Any noise which has the effect of materially interfering with the ordinary comforts of
life judged by the standard of a reasonable man is nuisance. How and when a nuisance
created by noise becomes actionable has to be answered with reference to its degree
and the surrounding circumstances, the place and the time.7.
