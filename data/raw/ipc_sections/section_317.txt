Death caused by act done with intent to cause miscarriage—.
Whoever, with intent to cause the miscarriage of a woman with child, does any act
which causes the death of such woman, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to
fine,
if act done without woman's consent.
And if the act is done without the consent of the woman, shall be punished either
with 698.[imprisonment for life], or with the punishment above mentioned.
Explanation.— It is not essential to this offence that the offender should know that
the act is likely to cause death.
COMMENT.—
This section provides for the case where death occurs in causing miscarriage. The act
of the accused must have been done with intent to cause the miscarriage of a woman
with child.
[s 314.1] CASES.—
The son-in-law of a pregnant woman left her at the house of the accused doctor. Her
dead body was recovered from the place where it was buried in the accused's house. It
was in a decomposed state. The accused made extra-judicial confessions to three
different persons to the effect that the death took place during abortion. Circumstantial
evidence also proved this fact beyond reasonable doubt. His conviction under the
section was confirmed as also the five-year RI sentence, but fine was set aside.699. A
homeopath operated upon a pregnant woman to cause abortion but she died a few
hours after operation because her uterus got perforated. His conviction under section
314 was upheld.700. A nurse attempted to cause miscarriage of a pregnant girl but was
unsuccessful. On the third day another person, the accused, an attendant, made an
attempt and succeeded but the condition of the girl became serious after five days.
She was hospitalised and died of septicaemia which had developed from ruptures and
tears in the internal parts of vagina. There was no evidence to show that ruptures and
tears had occurred at the hands of the accused. It was held that his conviction under
section 314 was not proper.701.
A person, named, C, was alleged to have had illicit relations with the deceased woman.
He took her to a doctor for the purpose of aborting her pregnancy. The doctor caused
her death in that process. The doctor was not qualified for the purpose, nor his clinic
was approved by the Government under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act,
1971 and was also not having the basic facilities for abortion. There was a concurrent
finding that the act was done by the doctor in furtherance of the common intention with
C. It was held that the conviction of C under this section read with section 34 was
proper.702.
[s 314.2] Section 313 and Section 314.—
Ingredients for both these offences are contra-indicative and cannot go together. When
conviction is recorded under section 304-A, it pre-supposes a negligent act, which
would rule out any intentional act; whereas the conviction for offences under sections
313 and 314 can be founded only on intentional act of the accused and not negligence.
Presence of mens rea would be sine qua non in such a situation. The trial Court,
therefore, apparently erred in recording conviction of the appellants for offences
punishable under sections 304-A and 313 and 314 of IPC, 1860.703.
