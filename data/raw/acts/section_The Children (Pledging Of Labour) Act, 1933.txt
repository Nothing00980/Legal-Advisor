The Children (Pledging Of Labour) Act, 1933
(2 OF 1933)
356.
 


Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The Royal Commission of Labour found evidence  in such widely separated areas as Amritsar, Ahmedabad and Madras of the practice of  pledging child labour, that is, the taking of advances by parents or guardians on  agreements, written or oral, pledging the labour of their children. In some cases, the  children so pledged were subjected to particularly unsatisfactory working conditions. The  Commission considered that the State would be justified in adopting strong measures to  eradicate the evil, and the Bill seeks to do so by imposing penalties or parents by agreements  pledging the labour of children and on person knowingly employing children whose labour  has been pledged.
[24th February, 1933]
