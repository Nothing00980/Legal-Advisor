than on grave provocation.

that person, otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that person,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
State Amendment
Andhra Pradesh.—The offence under section 55 is non-cognizable, bailable and triable by
any Magistrate vide A.P. Act No. 3 of 1992 section 2 (w.e.f. 15-2-1992).
COMMENT.—
The intention to dishonour may be supposed to exist when the assault or criminal force
is by means of gross insults. An accused person while under trial struck a Sub-
Inspector of Police who was in the witness-box giving evidence against him. It was held
that he was guilty of this offence.1049.
