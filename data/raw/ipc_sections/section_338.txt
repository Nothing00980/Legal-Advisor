Explanation.—The last two sections are subject to the same provisos as Exception 1,
section 300.
COMMENT.—
This section serves as a proviso to sections 325 and 326. However, in the absence of
the exact words being recorded, the abuses even involving mother and sister which are
commonly indulged in by rustic villagers like the accused, could not be regarded as
grave and sudden within the meaning of this section.883. Unless there is sudden and
grave provocation, section 335 will not be attracted.884.
