COMMENT.â€”
This and the following section have been inserted because the ordinary law of
abetment is inapplicable. They apply when suicide is in fact committed. In order to
frame charge under section 305 of IPC, 1860 the material placed by the prosecution
before the trial judge must be such that if it is accepted at its face value, it would
establish that the commission of suicide by the girl below 18 years of age was the
direct and proximate cause of the abetment or instigation offered by the applicant.576.

1956).
