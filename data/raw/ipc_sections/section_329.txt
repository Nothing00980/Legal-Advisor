Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means.
Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 335, voluntarily causes grievous
hurt by means of any instrument for shooting, stabbing or cutting, or any instrument
which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, or by means of fire or
any heated substance, or by means of any poison or any corrosive substance, or by
means of any explosive substance, or by means of any substance which it is
deleterious to the human body to inhale, to swallow, or to receive into the blood, or by
means of any animal, shall be punished with 805.[imprisonment for life], or with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.—
The relationship between this section and the preceding one is the same as that
between sections 324 and 323. Before a conviction for the sentence of grievous hurt
can be passed, one of the injuries defined in section 320 must be strictly proved, and
the eighth clause is no exception to the general rule of law that a penal statute must be
construed strictly. The expression "any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence,
is likely to cause death" has to be gauged taking note of the heading of the section.
The essential ingredients to attract section 326 are:
(1) voluntarily causing a hurt;
(2) hurt caused must be a grievous hurt; and
(3) the grievous hurt must have been caused by dangerous weapons or means.806.
[s 326.1] Dangerous weapon.—
What would constitute a 'dangerous weapon' would depend upon the facts of each
case and no generalisation can be made. The heading of the section provides some
insight into the factors to be considered. As was noted by the Supreme Court in State
of UP v Indrajeet alias Sukhatha,807. there is no such thing as a regular or earmarked
weapon for committing murder or for that matter a hurt. Whether a particular article
can per se cause any serious wound or grievous hurt or injury has to be determined
factually. At this juncture, it would be relevant to note that in some provisions, e.g.,
sections 324 and 326 expression "dangerous weapon" is used. In some other more
serious offences the expression used is "deadly weapon" (e.g., sections 397 and 398).
The facts involved in a particular case, depending upon various factors like size,
sharpness, would throw light on the question whether the weapon was a dangerous or
deadly weapon or not. That would determine whether in the case section 325 or
section 326 would be applicable.808.
In the absence of any evidence that the stick which was used as a weapon of offence
was of lethal type and something like sharp blade or sharp point, etc., was attached to
it, the stick was held to be not an instrument within the meaning of this section.809.
Where the accused-teacher assaulted the child-student with a wooden stick that
caused injury to the eye of the child but there was no material to show that the stick
that was wielded by the accused was a dangerous weapon, the conviction of the
accused under section 326 may not be warranted; but the offence would fall under
section 325 IPC, 1860.810.
[s 326.2] Injuries not serious enough to endanger life.—
It was proved that the accused persons caused injuries which led to the victim's death.
He did not receive any medical assistance for full four hours. He lost a lot of blood
which became the cause of death. None of the injuries were on the vital parts of the
body. They were not serious enough to endanger life by themselves. The Court said
that at the highest, the accused persons could be said to be guilty under sections
326/34 for causing grievous hurt.811. In an altercation the accused persons beat the
injured with fist and leg blows on stomach and waist. An attempt was made to help
him out of the injury by fomenting at home. But he had to be shifted to hospital and
operated upon. It was held that the accused was guilty of attempt to cause grievous
hurt and not attempt to murder.812. The accused persons armed with lathis and a tangi
went to the field of the victims and picked up a fight while they were ploughing their
field. Looking at the attack they ran away. On their way back they met the uncle of their
victims who happened to ask them about the matter. They being annoyed by the
question, hit him on the head with a lathi. He died. The Court viewed the act as only one
intended to cause grievous hurt. Sentence of five years RI was awarded.813.
[s 326.3] Internal injuries.—
On account of a quarrel, the husband kicked his wife in the abdomen and chest. Liver
injuries were caused of which she died. Conviction was recorded under section 326.
There was no appeal by the State for any higher punishment. There was no evidence to
suggest any dowry demand. Hence, there could be no conviction under section
498A.814.
[s 326.4] Disfiguration.—
The wife of the accused was being taken to a Police Station in execution of search
warrant accompanied by a police constable. The accused assaulted his wife and
caused injuries resulting in amputation of her limbs. The whole nose was also cut,
which itself was held to be sufficient to attract permanent disfiguration. Conviction of
the accused under section 326 was not interfered with.815.
[s 326.5] Burn Injuries.—
Incident of throwing burning Kerosene Lamp by accused on complainant and the
complainant sustained 25–30 per cent burn injuries on chest, abdomen and hands.
Doctor clarified that burn injuries are fatal and dangerous to life in case the injuries get
infected and develop into septicaemia. Therefore, injuries cannot be said to be fatal.
Accused was liable to be convicted only under section 326 of IPC, 1860 not under
section 307.816.
[s 326.6] Acid attack.—
The accused threw acid on the faces of their victims. Medical evidence showed that
the injuries caused on the faces and eyes were not sufficient to cause death, conviction
of the accused under section 307 was altered to one under section 326. The Court
observed that unless it can be shown that the intention or knowledge of the accused
was to cause such bodily injury as would come within one of the four clauses of
section 300, he cannot be held guilty of an offence under section 307.817.
[s 326.7] Attack with axe.—
Protest against cutting of trees became the cause for assault. The accused and his
companions started assaulting. The victim received a head injury with an axe. The blow
caused fracture because of its force. The accused persons were not entitled to the
benefit of private defence, they being the aggressors.818.
[s 326.8] Attack with piece of stone.—
The weapon of assault was a piece of stone. As per the evidence of the doctor, the
injury caused was grievous one. But considering the size of the stone used for the
purpose, it could not be said that a dangerous weapon was used. The conviction was
altered to section 325 from section 326.819.
[s 326.9] Counter case.—
In a case the accused inflicted a knife blow to a man and the accused was also injured
during the same incident and filed a counter case but took no steps to bring his case to
trial. It was held that filing of the counter case was not fatal to the prosecution case
though both the cases should have been clubbed together. Conviction of the accused
under section 326 was upheld.820. The eye-witnesses who deny the presence of
injuries on the person of the accused are lying on the most material point, and
therefore, their evidence is unreliable.821.
[s 326.10] Feeding prasad containing poison.—
The accused distributed prasad to persons on relay fast. It contained poison. One
person died, others affected. The Court was of the view that it could not be said that
there was intention to kill a particular person, distribution being made openly. But
because the accused must have had knowledge that a poisonous substance may
cause grievous hurt or even death. In respect of the death he was convicted under
section 304, Part I and in respect of others affected under section 326.822.
[s 326.11] Protest against eve-teasing.—
The accused were friends of the victim who had objected to eve-teasing by one of
them. The victim-protestor was assaulted. It was held that they could be convicted
individually for their role in the assault under section 326 but not for the murder. There
was no common intention of going to that extent.823.
[s 326.12] Uncertainty as to cause of death.—
The first doctor who examined the injured person in the hospital stated that none of the
injuries either individually or collectively appeared to be dangerous to life. The doctor
who last examined the patient stated that 'A' group blood having been exhausted, 'O'
group blood was given and death might have been due to blood reaction. The post-
mortem doctor stated that death was due to rupture of liver. The conviction was shifted
from under sections 302/34 to that under sections 325–326/34.824.
[s 326.13] Torture in police custody.—
Victim was arrested and kept in police station for three days and was not produced
before a Magistrate within 24 hours. Third degree methods adopted on him and his
penis was also chopped off with a barber's razor. It was a barbaric act on the part of
the accused, who deserve no leniency. Both accused persons are held guilty under
section 326 IPC, 1860.825.
[s 326.14] Section 307 vis-a-vis Section 326.—
In some cases offence under section 326 IPC, 1860 may be acutely more serious than
another falling under section 307 IPC, 1860. For instance, acid thrown on the face of
young, unmarried girl would come under section 326 IPC, 1860 but it would be far more
serious than a firearm shot missing the victim that would fall under section 307 IPC,
1860.826. A bare perusal of these two provisions clearly reveals that while section 307
IPC, 1860 uses the words "under such circumstances", these words are conspicuously
missing from section 326 IPC, 1860. Therefore, while deciding whether the case falls
under section 307 IPC, 1860 or under section 326 IPC, 1860 the Court must necessarily
examine the circumstances in which the assault was made.827. Doctor categorically
stated that injury could have caused death. Radiologist also stated that chopping of the
leg was grievous act in nature. The Supreme Court held that High Court was not
justified in altering conviction from section 307 read with section 149 to 326 read with
section 149 IPC, 1860.828. Number of injures were quite grievous but accused were
careful not to give any blow on any vital part of body. Doctor did not say that injuries
were sufficient in the course of nature to cause death. Therefore, accused was
convicted under section 326 IPC, 1860 instead of section 307 IPC, 1860.829.
[s 326.15] Punishment.—
Imposing only fine while convicting the accused under section 326 and not imposing
punishment of imprisonment, was held to be a non-compliance of the provisions of the
code.830. Accused poured acid on the head of victim with the result that face, neck,
eyes, chest, etc., were seriously burnt. High Court reduced sentence from three years to
already undergone (35 days). For such a heinous crime accused deserves no
leniency.831.
In a case,832. the Supreme Court held the imposition of three months' imprisonment to
be proper but pointed out that the Courts below should have taken notice of the
provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 or of section 360 Cr PC, 1973. While
upholding the sentence, the Court directed the prisoner to be released on probation.
Often in Court at the sentencing stage the spotlight fell almost entirely upon the
offender and the circumstances of the offender, and there was seldom reference to the
suffering of the victim of violence.833.
[s 326.16] Offence not compoundable.—
In Suresh Babu v State of AP,834. Supreme Court allowed the compounding of an
offence under section 326 IPC, 1860 even though such compounding was not
permitted by section 320 of the Code. However, in Surendra Nath Mohanty v State of
Orissa,835. and in Ramlal v State of Jammu and Kashmir,836. it was held that an offence
which law declares to be non-compoundable cannot be compounded at all even with
the permission of the Court and held Suresh Babu,837. per incuriam. In Jalaluddin v State
of UP,838. and in Bankat v State,839. the Apex Court reiterated that as the offence under
section 326, IPC, 1860 is not compoundable, even if the parties settled the matter. In
Ramgopal v State of MP,840. Supreme Court held as follows:
There are several offences under the IPC that are currently non - compoundable. These
include offences punishable u/s. 498-A, s. 326, etc. of the IPC. Some of such offence can be
made compoundable by introducing a suitable amendment in the statute. We are of the
opinion that the Law Commission of India could examine whether a suitable proposal can
be sent to the Union Government in this regard. Any such step would not only relieve the
Courts of the burden of deciding cases in which the aggrieved parties have themselves
arrived at a settlement, but may also encourage the process of reconciliation between them.
We, accordingly, request the Law Commission and the Government of India to examine all
these aspects and take such steps as may be considered feasible.
The Law Commission of India examined the issue in view of the direction in Ramgopal's
Case and submitted its 237th Report suggesting to make section 498A and section
324 compoundable: no changes were suggested regarding section 326. In Gian Singh v
State of Punjab,841. a three-Judge Bench held that sub-section (9) of section 320
mandates that no offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section.
Obviously, in view thereof the composition of an offence has to be in accord with
section 320 and in no other manner. But the power of compounding of offences given
to a Court under section 320 is materially different from the quashing of criminal
proceedings by the High Court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. In compounding
of offences, power of a criminal Court is circumscribed by the provisions contained in
section 320 and the Court is guided solely and squarely thereby while, on the other
hand, the formation of opinion by the High Court for quashing a criminal offence or
criminal proceeding or criminal complaint is guided by the material on record as to
whether the ends of justice would justify such exercise of power although the ultimate
consequence may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment. The result is, though section
326 IPC, 1860 is a non-compoundable offence, the High Court can quash the
proceedings by using its inherent power under section 482 Cr PC, 1973 in case of
settlement between the parties.
