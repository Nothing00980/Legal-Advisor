COMMENT—
Affray.—The word 'affray' is derived from the French word affraier, to terrify, and in a
legal sense it is taken for a public offence to the terror of the people. The essence of
the offence consists in the terror it is likely to cause to the public. The Criminal
Procedure Code, 1973 has now made it a cognizable offence.
[s 160.1] Ingredients.—
This section requires three things—
1. Two or more persons must fight.
2. They must fight in a public place.
3. They must disturb the public peace.
The first basic ingredient of section 159, IPC, 1860, is fighting between two or more
persons. The next ingredient is that the fighting should have been in public place and
the last ingredient is that the fighting should have disturbed public peace.218.
1. 'Two or more persons'.—An affray requires two persons at the least. An unlawful
assembly requires five. The offence of Affray is a fight, i.e., a bilateral act, in which two
parties participate and it will not amount to an affray when the party who is assaulted
submits to the assault without resistance. Again, there must be a definite disturbance
of the public peace due to the fight in the public place to make the offence affray.219.
2. 'Fighting in a public place'.—'Public place' is a place where the public go, no matter
whether they have a right to go or not. Many shows are exhibited to the public on
private property, yet they are frequented by the public—the public go there.220.
The expression 'Fighting' in section 159, IPC, 1860, is used in its ordinary sense and it
means a combat or quarrel involving exchange of some force or violence, if not blows.
Mere verbal quarrel or vulgarly abusing sans violence cannot be construed as fighting
which contemplates bilateral use of violence by two competing parties. Even if there is
no exchange of blows, there should be exchange of some violence between the two
contending parties before it can be said that the parties are fighting. If one person uses
violence against another and the other person merely remains passive, it cannot be
said that there is a fighting, so also, if neither person uses violence against the other
but both the persons indulge in verbal abuses, it does not amount to fighting.221. Mere
causing inconvenience to the public is not sufficient.222.
3. 'Disturb the public peace'.—An affray is an offence against the public peace because
it is committed in a public place and is likely to cause general alarm and disturbance.
Mere causing public inconvenience is not enough.223. Before a conviction can be
entered under section 160, IPC, 1860, there must be a clear finding by the court that the
place of occurrence was a public place. If there is no such finding the accused persons
must be acquitted.224.
[s 160.2] Affray and riot.—An affray differs from a riot.
(1) An affray cannot be committed in a private place, a riot can be.
(2) An affray can be committed by two or more persons, a riot, by five or more.
[s 160.3] Affray and assault.—An affray differs from an assault.—
(1) The former must be committed in a public place; the latter may take place
anywhere.
(2) The former is regarded as an offence against the public peace; the latter,
against the person of an individual. An affray is nothing more than an assault
committed in a public place and in a conspicuous manner, and is so called
because it affrighteth and maketh men afraid.
