COMMENT.—
Ingredients.—(i) the offence must have been committed, i.e., completed and there must
be an 'offender';
(ii) there must be harbouring or concealment of a person by the accused;
(iii) the accused knows or has reason to believe that such harboured or concealed
person is the offender;
(iv) there must be an intention on the part of the accused to screen the offender from
legal punishment.280.
[s 212.1] Offender.—
The word used is 'offender' and not 'accused' or a person convicted for that offence.
The person who is sheltering, harbouring or concealing that person must have
knowledge or has reason to believe that he is the 'offender'. The word "offender" is not
defined under IPC, 1860. "Offender" as per the Dictionary, means "a person who has
committed a crime or offence." Hence, a person who is convicted or acquitted may be
an offender, for the purpose of section 212. An "offender" for the purpose of section
212 is neither a convict nor an accused, but he is a person who has actually committed
the offence. The failure of the prosecution to prove the identity of the person who
committed the offence does not render the person, who committed the offence, not an
offender. He can be said to be an offender whose guilt has not been proved in Court.
Yet, he is an offender, if he has committed an offence.281.
This section applies to the harbouring of persons who have actually committed some
offence under the Penal Code or an offence under some special or local law, when the
thing punishable under such special or local law is punishable with imprisonment for a
term of six months or upwards. It does not apply to the harbouring of persons, not
being criminals, who merely abscond to avoid or delay a judicial investigation.282.
Where there was no material to show that the accused had the knowledge or that he
reasonably believed that he was harbouring or concealing a person who was an
offender and the essential feature of secrecy was totally absent, it was held that no
offence under section 212 was made out.283. It is the knowledge or the reasonable
belief of the accused under section.212 that the person whom, he has harboured or
concealed to be the offender, which is relevant. But, such knowledge or belief must be
entertained by the accused, on the date on which he commits the offence by
harbouring or concealing him.284.
In the conspiracy for assassination of the former Prime Minister of India (Mr. Rajiv
Gandhi), some of the accused persons appeared at the scene after achievement of the
object. They played the role of harbouring and sheltering the main accused persons
with full knowledge of their involvement in the assassination. They also made efforts to
destroy evidence. Their conviction under section 212 was held to be proper.285.
[s 212.2] Exception.—
The Exception only extends to cases where harbour is afforded by a wife or husband.
No other relationship can excuse the wilful receipt or assistance of felons; a father
cannot assist his child, a child his parent, a brother his brother, a master his servant, a
servant his master.
[s 212.3] Section 212 IPC, 1860 and section 39 of Code of Criminal Procedure
1973.—
It is the duty of every citizen who is aware of commission of or of the intention of any
other person to commit any offence punishable under sections 302, 304, 449, etc., to
forthwith give information to the nearest Magistrate or police-officer of such
commission of offence or intention. This provision is mandatory unless there is a
reasonable excuse for omission or failure to inform. Section 39 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure specifically provides that public "shall" give information to the police or the
nearest Magistrate regarding commission of certain offences referred to in the said
section. Section 39 is only a procedural section, violation of which is not made
punishable under any penal statute, but, if a person who has knowledge or reasonable
belief that a person is the offender can be treated as a person who is aware of the
commission of the offence and even if he is not punishable for violating section 39 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure when he harbours or conceals such an offender, he
must certainly be guilty for offence under section 212.286.
[s 212.4] Conviction of the person concealed–whether mandatory.—
Nowhere in section 212 it is stated that the person concealed should be convicted for
an offence. Even if the main offender leaves unpunished by the Court, the object of the
provision under section 212 requires that the person who has concealed or harboured
the offender whom he believes and knows has committed the offence shall not leave
unpunished if the other ingredients are established. The criminality lies in the act of
concealment committed with the knowledge or belief that the person who is harboured
or concealed is the offender and also with the criminal intention of screening him from
legal punishment.287.
