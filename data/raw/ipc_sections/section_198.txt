Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of
offence punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment.
Whoever gives or fabricates false evidence intending thereby to cause, or knowing it
to be likely that he will thereby cause, any person to be convicted of an offence which
102.[by the law for the time being in force in 103.[India]] is not capital, but punishable
with 104.[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment for a term of seven years or
upwards, shall be punished as a person convicted of that offence would be liable to be
punished.
ILLUSTRATION
A gives false evidence before a Court of Justice, intending thereby to cause Z to be
convicted of a dacoity. The punishment of dacoity is 105.[imprisonment for life], or
rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, with or without fine.
A, therefore, is liable to 106.[imprisonment for life] or imprisonment, with or without
fine.
COMMENT.—
This section is similar to the preceding section except as regards the gravity of the
offence in respect of which the perjury is committed. The preceding section deals with
perjury in the case of an offence punishable with death, this section deals with perjury
of an offence punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of
seven years or upwards. In the case of a person who burnt his own house and charged
another with the act, it was held that he should not be convicted under this section, but
under section 211,107. but where A, with a view to having B convicted, assisted in
concealing stolen railway pins in his house and field, it was held that A was properly
convicted of an offence under this section.108. Giving false evidence in support of the
prosecution case amounts to an offence under sections 193 and 195, IPC, 1860, and
not under section 211, IPC, 1860.109. Misstatement of facts and concealment of an
essential fact in a writ petition amounts to giving false evidence. The petitioner was
liable to face proceedings for giving false evidence.110. It is not necessary that
fabrication of false evidence takes place only inside the Court as it can also be
fabricated outside the Court though has been used in the Court.111.
A Disciplinary Proceedings Tribunal is not a Court for the purposes of this section. It is
not "a court in the accepted sense of that term, though it may possess some of the
trappings of a court."112. A party giving an answer to a question put under Order 10 r. 2
of the CPC when not under oath and when not being examined as a witness, cannot
attract section 195 IPC, 1860.113. Police-officers fabricated the evidence in order to
book the appellant under TADA. From the materials on record, Supreme Court was of
the opinion that it is expedient in the interest of justice that an enquiry should be made
in accordance with sub-section (1) of section 340, Cr PC, 1973 into the commission of
offences under sections 193, 195 and 211.114.
