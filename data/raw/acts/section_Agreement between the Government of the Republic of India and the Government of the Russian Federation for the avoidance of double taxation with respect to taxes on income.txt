Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation
1. In the case of Russia double taxation is eliminated as follows:


Where a resident of Russia derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, may be taxed in India, the amount of tax on that income payable in India may be credited against the tax imposed on that resident of Russia. The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed the amount of the tax on that income computed in accordance with the taxation laws and regulations of Russia.
2. In the case of India double taxation is eliminated as follows:


Where a resident of India derives income which in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, may be taxed in Russia, India shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the income-tax paid in Russia whether directly or by deduction at source. Such deduction in either case shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax (as computed before the deduction is given) which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in Russia.
3. For the purposes of this Article the term "tax" paid or payable as mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall be deemed to include the tax which would have been paid but for any exemption or reduction of tax granted under incentive provisions contained in the law of a Contracting State designed to promote economic development to the extent that such exemption or reduction is granted for profits from industrial construction, manufacturing or agricultural activities provided that the activities have been carried out within the Contracting State.


The competent authorities may agree to extend the application of this provision also to other activities.
The provisions of this paragraph shall apply only for the first ten years during which this Agreement is effective. This period may be extended by a mutual agreement between the competent authorities.
Article 24
Non-Discrimination
1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.
2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities in the same circumstances and under the same conditions.
3. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.
4. Except where the provisions of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.
5. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected there with which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected in the same circumstances and under the same conditions.
6. The provisions of this Article shall apply to taxes which are the subject of this Agreement.


Article 25
Mutual Agreement Procedure
1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present this case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.
2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits provided for in the domestic laws of the Contracting States.
3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult with each other for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in this Agreement.
4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.


Article 26

Any information received by a Contracting State shall be treated as confidential in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes covered by the Agreement. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes, but may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions.

The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall agree from time to time on the list of the information or documents which shall be furnished on a routine basis.
