COMMENT.—
False statement on oath.—This section should be compared with section 191. Under it
a false statement to any public servant, or other person, authorised to administer oath
or affirmation, is punishable.62. It does not apply where the public servant administers
the oath in a case wholly beyond his jurisdiction63. or where he is not competent to
make a statement on solemn affirmation.64.
[s 181.1] Failure to administer oath.—
In view of sections 4 and 5 of the Oaths Act, 1969, it is always desirable to administer
oath or statement may be recorded on affirmation of the witness. The Supreme Court
in Rameshwar v State of Rajasthan,65. has categorically held that the main purpose of
administering of oath is to render persons who give false evidence, liable to
prosecution and further to bring home to the witness the solemnity of the occasion and
to impress upon him the duty of speaking the truth, further such matters only touch
credibility and not admissibility. However, in view of the provisions of section 7 of the
Oaths Act, 1969, the omission of administration of oath or affirmation does not
invalidate any evidence.66.
