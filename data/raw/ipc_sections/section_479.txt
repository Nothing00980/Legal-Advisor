Forgery for purpose of cheating.

forged] shall be used for the purpose of cheating, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.—
This section does not require that the accused should actually commit the offence of
cheating. What is material is the intention or purpose of the offender in committing
forgery.61. Where documents had been forged and fabricated only to be used as
genuine to make fraudulent and illegal claim over land owned by complainant, the
Supreme Court held that it cannot be held that respondents were not makers of
documents or that filing of civil suit based on same would not constitute an offence.62.
The Supreme Court has expressed the opinion that the conduct of an Advocate's clerk
in forging the signature of another advocate on a surety bond and forging some
endorsements for identification and attestation, would not constitute an offence under
this section and that the conviction should have been under section 465.63.
[s 468.1] Banking and other frauds.—
Where the accused, being the BDO, who was authorised to recommend the sanctioning
of housing loans to the villagers misappropriated the money of the bank by availing
loans in their names by forging their signatures, he was held to be guilty based on the
evidence of the villagers that they did not apply under the scheme.64.
[s 468.2] Signing differently in vakalatnama.—
Where it was alleged that in order to cheat the Complainant the accused signed in his
vakalathnama differently from his signatures available in his income tax returns, the
Court quashed the complaint as neither the Complainant has alleged any 'forgery' by
the petitioners causing any damage, or injury to the public nor to any person, nor to
cause any person to part with property, nor to enter into any express or implied
contract, nor with intent to commit fraud to any person or the Complainant in
particular.65.
