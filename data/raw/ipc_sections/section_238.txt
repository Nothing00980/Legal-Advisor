COMMENT.â€”
'Possession' connotes the intention to exercise power or control over the object
possessed and therefore necessarily implies that the possessor has been conscious of
the possibility of exercising that power or control. Mere possession of instruments and
materials capable of counterfeiting coins is no offence. Possession of such
instruments should be with the intention of counterfeiting coins and the intention must
be proved. The onus of proving the fitness of the materials for the purpose of
counterfeiting coins was upon the prosecution.17. The minimum that would be required
for prosecution to establish a charge under sections 232 and 235 is that it establishes
that the coins seized resembled the original and that the resemblance is such that it
would deceive a person or that the accused knew that if the coin is used it would be
likely to deceive a person. Unless there is intrinsic evidence on record to show that the
coins indeed resemble genuine coins, it is difficult to accept the case of the
prosecution.18.
