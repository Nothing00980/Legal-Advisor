Robbery or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt.
If, at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly
weapon,1 or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or
grievous hurt to any person, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be
punished shall not be less than seven years.
COMMENT—
Sections 397 and 398 do not create any offence but merely regulate the punishment
already provided for robbery and dacoity.212. This section fixes a minimum term of
imprisonment when the commission of robbery and dacoity has been attended with
certain aggravating circumstances, viz., (1) the use of a deadly weapon, or (2) the
causing of grievous hurt, or (3) attempting to cause death or grievous hurt.
Section 34 of the Code has no application in the construction of this section.213.
[s 397.1] Accused must be armed with deadly weapon.—
It is necessary to prove that at the time of committing robbery, the accused was armed
with a deadly weapon and not merely that one of the robbers who was with him at the
time carried one.214. The liability to enhanced punishment is limited to the offender
who actually uses the weapon himself and causes grievous hurt and not to others who
in combination with such person have committed robbery or dacoity.215. The
expression 'the offender' occurring in this section pertains to actual offender. It does
not include all persons who participate in robbery or dacoity.216. The section does not
provide for constructive liability as in section 149.217.
1. 'Uses any deadly weapon'.—These words are wide enough to include a case in which
a person levels his revolver against another person in order to overawe him. It is not
correct to say that a person does not use a revolver unless he fires it.218. Where the
accused carried knife open to the view of the victims, it is sufficient use of a deadly
weapon to terrorise them within the meaning of this section and no other overt act as
brandishing of the knife is necessary to apply this section.219. In reference to the word
"uses" as it occurs in the section, it has been held that if the weapon carried by the
offender was within the vision of the victim so as to be capable of creating terror in his
mind that is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of use of deadly weapon. It is not
necessary to show further any hurt caused by the use of the weapon.220.
The section postulates only the individual act of the accused to be relevant. It thus
negates the application of the principle of constructive or vicarious liability as provided
in section 34. Where all the accused persons carried their respective deadly weapons, it
was held that each one of them satisfy the requirement of section 397. Conviction
could be only under section 397 and not section 397 read with section 34.221.
[s 397.2] Comparison with section 394.—
The section relates itself only to an offender who actually uses the weapon himself. It
has no scope for constructive liability. The accused in this case had not himself caused
any grievous hurt in the commission of the robbery. His conviction under this section
read with section 34 was not proper.222. The liability under section 397 is only
individual, whereas liability under section 394 is both individual and vicarious.223.
[s 397.3] Deadly weapon.—
In Babulal Jairam Maurya v State of Maharashtra,224. it was held that the word "deadly
weapon" as used here has to be a real deadly weapon and not just assumed or
mistaken to be a deadly weapon. A toy-pistol cannot be said to be a deadly weapon
whatever be its impact on persons who were frightened with it. Bamboo sticks or lathis,
which were possessed and held by the accused, were held by the Supreme Court to be
not deadly weapons. There was no evidence of any grievous hurt or attempt to inflict
it.225.
[s 397.4] Grievous hurt.—
Any hurt which endangers life is a grievous hurt. It would be seen that one of the
injuries was caused just below the nipple. The term 'endangers life' is much stronger
than the expression 'dangerous to life'. Apart from that in the provision, attempt to
cause grievous hurt attracts its application.226.
[s 397.5] Recovery of property.—
The Supreme Court observed in Lachhman Ram v State of Orissa:227. "The factum of
recovery of articles at the instance of the accused persons in the presence of police
officers and panch witnesses is itself sufficient to bring the case not only under section
412 but also under section 391".
[s 397.6] Death sentence.—
In a robbery and double murder case, it was found that the acts of the accused persons
were heinous and they had committed murder brutally and showed no regard for
human lives. They were hardened criminals with previous criminal records. It was held
that life imprisonment could not serve any reformative treatment to the accused. The
sentence was enhanced to capital punishment.228.
The accused was convicted for the offence of robbery and murder of five persons;
murders were premeditated and carried out for gain. The entire family was
exterminated in a cruel manner. The accused was a young person but not the
breadwinner of anyone. The imposition of death sentence was confirmed.229.
[s 397.7] Probation.—
The Supreme Court had granted the benefit of probation to the appellant who was less
than 21 years of age as on the date of the offence. The report of the Probation officer
had been called and keeping in view the circumstances as had been detailed in the
report of the Probation officer coupled with the fact that the appellant being less than
21 years of age on the date of offence, he had been granted benefit of probation.230.
