False information, with intent to cause public servant to use his
lawful power to the injury of another person.
Whoever gives to any public servant any information 1 which he knows or believes to
be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby
cause, such public servant—
(a) to do or omit anything2 which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the
true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by
him, or

person,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand
rupees, or with both.]

(a) A informs a Magistrate that Z, a police-officer, subordinate to such Magistrate,
has been guilty of neglect of duty or misconduct, knowing such information to
be false, and knowing it to be likely that the information will cause the
Magistrate to dismiss Z. A has committed the offence defined in this section.
(b) A falsely informs a public servant that Z has contraband salt in a secret place,
knowing such information to be false, and knowing that it is likely that the
consequence of the information will be a search of Z's premises, attended with
annoyance to Z. A has committed the offence defined in this section.
(c) A falsely informs a policeman that he has been assaulted and robbed in the
neighbourhood of a particular village. He does not mention the name of any
person as one of his assaitants, but knows it to be likely that in consequence of
this information the police will make enquiries and institute searches in the
village to the annoyance of the villages or some of them. A has committed an
offence under this section.]
COMMENT.—
Object.—The object of this section is that a public servant should not be falsely given
information with the intent that he should be misled by a person who believed that
information to be false, and intended to mislead him. This section does not require that
action must always be taken if the person who makes the public servant knows or
believes that action will be taken.68.
[s 182.1] Ingredients.—
(1) Giving of an information to a public servant.
(2) Information must have been known or believed to be false by the giver.
(3) Such false information was given with intention to cause, or knowing that it is likely
to cause such public servant (a) to do or omit anything which he ought not to do or
omit to do if the true facts were known to him, or (b) to use his lawful power to the
injury or annoyance of any person.69.
1. 'Any information'.—The Bombay and the Patna High Courts have ruled that any 'false
information' given to a public servant, with the intent mentioned in the section, is
punishable under it whether that information is volunteered by the informant or is given
in answer to questions put to him by the public servant.70. Where a driver of a motor
vehicle, who had no licence with him, on being asked his name by a police-officer, gave
a fictitious name, it was held that he had committed an offence under this section.71.
The section makes no distinction between information relating to a cognizable offence
and one relating to a non-cognizable offence, nor is there anything in the section to
justify the conclusion that it applies only to cases in which the information given to any
public servant relates to a cognizable offence.72.
2. 'To do or omit anything'.—It is not necessary that the public servant to whom false
information is given should be induced to do anything or to omit to do anything in
consequence of such information. The gist of the offence is not what action may or
may not be taken by the public servant to whom false information is given, but the
intention or knowledge (to be inferred from his conduct) of the person supplying such
information.73. Section 182 does not require that action must always be taken if the
person who moves the public servant knows or believes that action would be taken.74.
Under this clause it is not necessary to show that the act done would be to the injury or
annoyance of any third person.75.
[s 182.2] Condition precedent for prosecution.—
This section has to be read in conjunction with section 195(1)(a) of the Cr PC, 1973
which requires a complaint for offences under sections 172–188, IPC, 1860, to be filed
by the public servant concerned or by some other public servant to whom he is
administratively subordinate.76. It is mandatory to follow the procedure prescribed
under section 195 of the Code while initiating action against an accused for an offence
punishable under section 182, IPC, 1860 else such action is rendered void ab initio.77.
Thus, investigation into an offence under section 182, IPC, 1860 can be done only on
the complaint given by a competent public servant; taking note of the fact that the
procedure contemplated is not complied within the line with section 195, Cr PC, 1973
as well as the settled legal position evolved through the decisions of the Apex Court,
the cognizance assumed by the Magistrate for the offence under section 182, IPC,
1860 is erroneous and not sustainable in law.78. Similar view has been expressed by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in PD Lakhani v State of Punjab,79. relying upon its earlier
judgment in Daulat Ram's case (supra) and Mata Bhikh's case.80. It is held that:
no complaint, therefore, could be lodged before the learned Magistrate by the Station House
Officer. Even assuming that the same was done under the directions of SP, Section 195, in
no uncertain terms, directs filing of an appropriate complaint petition only by the public
servant concerned or his superior officer. It, therefore, cannot be done by an inferior officer.
It does not provide for delegation of the function of the public servant concerned81.
[s 182.3] Private Complaint.—
Since the offence under section 182 is covered by the bar of section 195 Cr PC, 1973
there is absolutely no scope for filing a private complaint. The embargo in section 195
Cr PC, 1973 takes away the right to prosecute in respect of the aforesaid offences by
way of filing a private complaint. Going by section 195 Cr PC, 1973 no Court shall take
cognizance except in the manner contemplated by section 195 Cr PC, 1973 and
consequently, no jurisdiction to refer the case under section 156(3) Cr PC, 1973 to the
Police for investigation or to issue a direction to proceed under the aforesaid sections
to the Police on a private person's complaint.82.
[s 182.4] Mala fide Prosecution.—
The Supreme Court has laid down that proceedings can be taken under this section as
well as under sections 211 and 500 against persons who initiate prosecution against a
person in high position with a view to wreaking vengeance for a private and personal
grudge.83.
[s 182.5] CASES.—Causing public servant to do what he ought not to do.—
Mere non-mentioning of the complaint already filed in the Court of Chief Judicial
Magistrate, in the petition filed under section 156(3) Cr PC, 1973 before the Special
Sessions Judge, would not be enough to attract the section.84. The accused falsely
telegraphed to a District Magistrate that the town had been attacked by a gang of 200
robbers, but the Magistrate put no faith in the telegram and took no action; it was held
that the accused were guilty of an offence under this section.85. A personated B at an
examination and passed the examination and obtained a certificate in B's name. B,
thereupon, applied to have his name entered in the list of candidates for Government
service. He attached to this application the certificate issued in his name, and his name
was ordered to be entered on the list of candidates. It was held that he was guilty of an
offence under this section.86. Where the ulterior motive of the accused in making a
false report of burglary was to suppress certain documents by pleading that they were
stolen, it was held that the act of the accused was not punishable under this section.87.
Where a resolution was passed in a public meeting condemning police inaction in
regard to an assault case and copies of the said resolution were sent to various
authorities including the Superintendent of Police and the officer-in-charge, but the
officer-in-charge took exception to it and filed a complaint in Court under sections 182
and 211, IPC, 1860, it was held that forwarding of the resolution did not amount to
institution of criminal proceeding and no offence either under section 182 or section
211, IPC, 1860, was committed. It was further observed that police should not be so
sensitive over public criticism.88.
[s 182.6] Period of Limitation.—
Since the offence under section 182 IPC, 1860 is punishable with imprisonment for a
period of six months only, the authority should file the complaint under section 182 IPC,
1860 within one year from the date when that authority found that the allegations made
in the complaint were false. Since more than four years was elapsed from the date
when the authority found the allegations were false, no question of filing any complaint
under section 182 IPC, 1860 at this belated stage arises.89.
