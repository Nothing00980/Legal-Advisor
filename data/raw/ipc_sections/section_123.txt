ILLUSTRATION
A instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he
would have been subject to the punishment of death or 110.[imprisonment for life].
Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years
and also to a fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he
will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and
to fine.
COMMENT.—
This section punishes the abetment of certain offences which are either not committed
at all, or not committed in consequence of abetment or only in part committed.
When more than ten persons are instigated to commit an offence punishable with
death, the offence comes under this section as well as under section 117. Abetment
under this section need not necessarily be abetment of the commission of an offence
by a particular person against a particular person.111.
1. 'Express provision'.—This refers to sections in which specific cases of abetment of
offences punishable with death or imprisonment for life are dealt with.112.
2. 'Such abetment'.—These words refer to the abetment of the offence specified in the
section itself, namely an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, and
only sections 121 and 131 provide for the punishment of the abetment of such
offence.113.
