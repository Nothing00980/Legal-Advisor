The word "Judge" denotes not only every person who is officially designated as
a Judge, but also every person,—
who is empowered by law to give, in any legal proceeding, civil or criminal, a definitive
judgment, or a judgment which, if not appealed against, would be definitive, or a
judgment which, if confirmed by some other authority, would be definitive, or
who is one of a body of persons, which body of persons is empowered by law to give
such a judgment.

COMMENT—
Section 19 IPC, 1860 defines a 'Judge' as denoting not only every person who is
officially designated as a Judge, but also every person who is empowered by law to
give in any legal proceedings, civil or criminal, a definitive judgment, or a judgment
which, if not appealed against, would be definitive, or a judgment which, if confirmed by
some other authority, would be definitive, or who is one of a body of persons
empowered by law to give such a judgment. The Collector is neither a Judge as defined
under section 19 nor does he act judicially, when discharging any of the functions
under the Land Acquisition Act.28. Regional Provident Fund Commissioner while
passing an order under section 7-A of Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous
Provisions Act 1952 was 'Judge' within definition under section 19 of IPC, 1860.29. The
right to pronounce a definitive judgment is considered the sine qua non of a Court.30.
Illustration (d) is very important as it indicates that a Magistrate, who has power to try
and determine cases, is a Court of Justice, but is not a Court of Justice when sitting in
committal proceedings.
