Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished with
319.[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which the death
is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury
as is likely to cause death,
or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years,
or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause
death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is
likely to cause death.
COMMENT.—
This section provides punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
Under it, there are two kinds of punishments applying to two different circumstances:
(1) If the act by which death is caused is done with intention of causing death or such
bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the punishment is imprisonment for life, or
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years and fine.
(2) If the act is done with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but without any
intention to cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the punishment
is imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with
fine, or with both.
A conviction under Part II of this section read with section 34 is legal and valid. Part II
of this section can be read together with section 34, notwithstanding that Part II speaks
only of knowledge while section 34 deals with intention.320.
Commission of the offence of culpable homicide would require some positive act on
the part of the accused as distinguished from silence, inaction or a mere lapse.
Allegations of not carrying out a prompt search of the missing children; of delay in the
lodging of formal complaint with the police and failure to take adequate measures to
guard the access from the ashram to the river, which are the principal allegations made
in the FIR, cannot make out a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder
punishable under section 304, IPC, 1860.321.
[s 304.1] Distinction between the provisions of section 304, Part I and Part II.—
Linguistic distinction between the two Parts of section 304 is evident from the very
language of this section. There are two apparent distinctions, one in relation to the
punishment while other is founded on the intention of causing that act, without any
intention but with the knowledge that the act is likely to cause death. It is neither
advisable nor possible to state any straight-jacket formula that would be universally
applicable to all cases for such determination. Every case essentially must be decided
on its own merits. The Court has to perform the very delicate function of applying the
provisions of the Code to the facts of the case with a clear demarcation as to under
what category of cases, the case at hand falls and accordingly punish the accused.322.
[s 304.2] Is section 304, Part II applicable only when exceptions to section 300
cover a case?.—
The plea that section 304, Part II applies only when exceptions to section 300 cover a
case is misconceived. The decision in Harendra Mandal's case,323. was rendered in a
different context and observations in the same case cannot be read out of context.
That was a case where death itself had not been caused and therefore, question of
applying section 304, IPC, 1860 did not arise.324. Section 304, Part II comes into play
when the death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death
but there is no intention on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause
such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.325.
[s 304.3] Section 302 or section 304.—Judicial dilemma.—
The Indian Penal Code was enacted in the year 1860 under which the offences within
the territory of India have been tried ever since it was enacted dealing with countless
number of cases leading either to acquittal or conviction. Yet, the task of the decision-
making authorities/Courts of whether an offence of culpable homicide is murder or
culpable homicide does not amount to murder in the prevailing facts and
circumstances of the case is a perennial question with which the Courts are often
confronted. When the evidence discloses a clear case of murder or makes out a finding
of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the task of the Courts to record
conviction or acquittal is generally an easy one. But this task surely becomes an
undaunted one when the accused commits culpable homicide/murder but the
circumstances disclose many a times that it is done without premeditation or pre-
planning, may be to cause grievous hurt, yet it is so grave in nature that it results into
death and the role of the factum causing death without premeditation becomes a
secondary consideration due to which the decision of the Courts in such cases often
hinges on discretion while considering whether the case would fall under section 302,
IPC, 1860 or it would be under section 304, Part I or even Part II, IPC, 1860. On a plain
reading of section 299, section 300, section 302 and section 304 of IPC, 1860, it
appears that given cases can be conveniently classified into two categories, viz.,
culpable homicide amounting to murder which is section 302, IPC, 1860 or culpable
homicide not amounting to murder which is section 304 IPC, 1860. But when it comes
to the actual application of these two sections in a given case, the Courts are often
confronted with a dilemma as to whether a case would fall under section 302, IPC,
1860 or would fall under section 304, IPC, 1860. Many a time, this gives rise to
conflicting decisions of one Court or the other giving rise to the popular perception
among litigants and members of the Bar that a particular Court is an acquitting Court
or is a convicting one. This confusion or dilemma often emerges in a case when the
question for consideration is whether a given case would fall under section 302, IPC,
1860 or section 304, IPC, 1860 when it is difficult to decipher from the evidence
whether the intention was to cause merely bodily injury which would not make out an
offence of murder or there was clear intention to kill the victim making out a clear case
of an offence of murder.326. Section 300 states both, what is murder and what is not.
First finds place in section 300 in its four stated categories, while the second finds
detailed mention in the stated five exceptions to section 300. The legislature in its
wisdom, thus, covered the entire gamut of culpable homicide that 'amounting to
murder' as well as that 'not amounting to murder' in a composite manner in section 300
of the Code. It is neither advisable nor possible to state any straightjacket formula that
would be universally applicable to all cases for such determination. Every case
essentially must be decided on its own merits. The Court has to perform the very
delicate function of applying the provisions of the Code to the facts of the case with a
clear demarcation as to under what category of cases, the case at hand falls and
accordingly punish the accused.327. It has been held that unless the case falls under
one of the specified exception in section 300, it cannot be brought under Part I or Part II
of section 304 of IPC, 1860.328.
[s 304.4] CASES.—
Where the accused husband suspecting the fidelity of his wife quarrelled with her,
poured kerosene on her body and set her on fire and subsequently, when she screamed
for help, tried to extinguish fire by pouring water, the Supreme Court held that he was
having full knowledge that his act would cause her death and the attempt of
extinguishing the fire will not mitigate the offence, hence he was liable under section
302, IPC, 1860 and not under section 304, IPC, 1860.329. The accused followed his
daughter into the women's public toilet of the village and assaulted her. The fatal
injuries resulted in her instant death. None of the exceptions in section 300 of IPC,
1860 was attracted. It would necessarily follow that the accused committed murder of
his daughter. He was liable to be punished with either imprisonment for life or death
under section 302, IPC, 1860 alone.330. The accused killed his stepfather, who was an
infirm old man and an invalid, with the latter's consent, his motive being to get three
innocent men (his enemies) hanged. It was held that the offence was covered by
Exception 5 to section 300 and was punishable under the first Part of this section.331.
Where the deceased, an old man with an enlarged and flabby heart, was lifted by the
accused during a quarrel and thrown on the ground from some distance with sufficient
force and the deceased got his ribs fractured and died of a rupture of the heart, it was
held that the offence fell under section 325 and not under Part II of this section, as the
accused had no intention or knowledge to cause death.332. Accused stabbed the
deceased in a sudden incident during an election fever which resulted in his death four
days later in hospital where he had been operated upon in a bid to save his life. There
was no evidence that the accused intended to cause death or cause such bodily injury
as was sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death. In the circumstances, it
was held that the case fell within clause (b) of section 299 but did not fall within clause
3 of section 300, IPC, 1860, and as such his conviction under section 302 was set aside
and he was convicted under section 304, Part I of the Code.333. Similarly, where a
young lad of 18½ years old gave only one kassi blow to the deceased following an
altercation between his father and the deceased, which resulted in latter's death six
days after, it could not be said that he had intended to cause an injury which was
sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death within the meaning of clause 3 of
section 300, IPC, 1860. He could be at best saddled with knowledge that his act might
result in death. His conviction was, therefore, changed from section 302 to section 304,
Part II, IPC, 1860.334. Accused, in a sudden quarrel gave a blow on the head of his
friend with a stick weighing only 210 grams which caused his death. It was held that
his conviction under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860, was improper as it could not be said
that he had knowledge that such a blow would cause death. His conviction was,
therefore, changed to one under section 323, IPC, 1860.335. In a dispute regarding the
right of way, the accused gave a single fist blow on the head of the deceased which
resulted into his death. No weapon was used, nor was there any past enmity between
them. The accused was not held to be responsible for the death of the deceased and
was sentenced under section 323, IPC, 1860.336. Where a man lifted a four-year-old
child and threw him on the ground and thus caused his death, it was held that
knowledge of death under section 299, IPC, 1860, could be safely attributed to him and
he was therefore liable under section 304, Part-II, IPC, 1860.337. In a sudden quarrel, the
accused, a young man, administered a single knife blow on the chest of the deceased
causing his death, it was held that the case did not fall under clauses 1 and 2 of section
300 but since he had knowledge that death might follow, he was guilty under section
304, Part II, IPC, 1860.338. A police officer was punished under Part II of this section
with seven-year RI for causing death in custody by resorting to third-degree
methods.339. A woman deserted her husband and started living with her paramour six
months before the incident. Her fisherman husband, on way back from his work,
spotted her sitting among women at outside of a neighbouring house. He approached
towards her. On seeing him, she ran inside. He chased and stabbed her to death. His
conviction under Part II and sentence of five-year rigorous imprisonment was held to be
not excessive.340. A group of persons called out the deceased from his home with a
view to lodging a protest but suddenly one of them inflicted a knife wound which falling
on the chest killed the deceased. The Supreme Court convicted the single wound-
causing accused under this section saying that the heat of passion generated at the
spur of the moment and not any intention to cause death was responsible for the
incident.341. In another case of the same kind before the Supreme Court, the finding
was that the wrestler-accused had an altercation with the deceased two or three days
before the incident. The prosecution showed that the accused came to the house of
the deceased, but suppressed further knowledge about the incident. Drops of blood in
the house showed that the deceased was injured there, ran out and fell dead. There
was only one major injury. Conviction under Part I of this section was considered to be
appropriate.342. Annoyance was caused by the deceased singing a vulgar song. Quarrel
and beating in consequence continued for some time. Accused started beating the
deceased with a stick not thick enough to cause rupture of the spleen. He might not
have had the intention to cause death but had knowledge that death might result. His
conviction under section 300 (second) was converted into one under section 304, Part
II.343. Where the victim was dragged for about 120 feet and then struck with a crowbar
not using much force, the accused knowing that the assault might cause death but not
intending it. Part II was held to be attracted and not Part I.344. A person reaching home
in a drunken state started beating his wife. Their son intervened and the accused
hurled stones on him twice. The boy succumbed to the head injury then and there.
Conviction was shifted from under section 302 to 304, Part II, knowledge that death
might be caused.345.
Persons exceeding the right of private defence are punished under section 304, Part I
and not under section 302.346. Where the deceased died due to the negligent firing by a
person, who came for celebrating a marriage function with a gun, it was held that
though it is not possible to attribute intention, it is equally not possible to hold that the
act was done without the knowledge that it is likely to cause death. Everybody, who
carries a gun with live cartridges and even others know that firing a gun and that too in
the presence of several people is an act, which is likely to cause death. Hence, the
liability under section 304, Part II. The appellant caused the death of his wife by beating
her with a wooden stick. No intention to cause death was proved. He was convicted
under section 304, Part II.347.
Where the death of a player was caused by blowing a cricket stump on him in a friendly
cricket match and it was found that the accused player did not know that his act would
cause an injury which would cause death or which was likely to cause death, it was
held that a conviction under section 304, Part II was not proper, but that an offence
under section 325 was made out as the injury was caused by a stump which is a blunt
weapon.348.
A married woman (25 years) met a sudden death in her matrimonial home. Her letters
and complaints spoke of harassment. The medical report put the cause of death as
rupture of spleen and pancreas caused by external pressure. Her husband, who was
attempting to escape by resorting to the theory of death by poisoning, was found guilty
and his conviction under Part II of this section and sentence of five years of RI was
upheld by the Supreme Court. Though he might not have intended to cause death, he
did cause an injury about which he must have known that it might cause death.349.
Where one of the accused came forward and delivered a blow on the head of a man
which proved fatal, the Apex Court was of the view that his act did not attract clause (1)
or (3) of section 300 because the accused was armed with no deadly weapon and the
head injury was caused by a farmer with an agricultural instrument which he happened
to carry with him. Conviction of the accused causing head injury under section 300 was
altered to one under section 304, Part II.350. Several persons surrounded a man. Firstly,
he was pushed down on the ground and then two injuries were caused to him one each
by two assailants one of whom was acquitted. Opinion of the doctor was that the
victim died due to shock and haemorrhage resulting from both the injuries. The one
injury alone caused by the accused was not individually sufficient to cause death. His
conviction was altered from section 300 to that under section 304, Part II.351. Where
the accused inflicted a single knife wound in the abdomen of a man which proved fatal
and the opinion of the doctor was that, but for complications, the injury was not
sufficient to cause death, it was held that the offence did not attract clause (3) of
section 300. He was convicted under section 304, Part II.352. A husband, without any
history of ill-feeling with his wife, attacked her with the blunt side of an axe and caused
a head injury after she fell down of which she died, his conviction under Part I of this
section was held to be proper.353. Where a person killed his wife under grave and
sudden provocation, a lenient punishment of two years' imprisonment was awarded to
him taking into consideration the welfare of his children.354. Where the accused
delivered a single stab blow on the chest of his wife out of sheer frustration,
momentary impulse and anger, on her refusal to oblige him with sex without any
intention to cause her death, his act was held to be culpable homicide not amounting to
murder and his conviction was altered from section 302 to section 304, Part I.355.
A pregnant woman went to draw water from a well but she was stopped from doing so
by several persons armed with 'lathis' and started abusing her and one of them dealt a
'lathi' blow on her head and another kicked her abdomen, as a result she died on the
spot and her son who tried to rescue her was also injured. Looking at the conduct of
the accused, it could not be said that they had common object to kill the woman or
cause injury to her son. Both the assailants were convicted under section 304, Part II
and others were acquitted.356.
The death of a young boy was caused in a brutal and cruel manner. The trial Court
convicted under sections 302/304. The High Court converted it to section 304 without
specifying whether the case fell within Part I or II. Sentence of seven years'
imprisonment was imposed. The Supreme Court did not interfere.357.
[s 304.5] CASES under Part I.—
Where the accused with the intention of obstructing the marriage of his sister with the
deceased, gave only one blow which proved fatal and the accused did not repeat the
blow though there was nothing to stop him, conviction and sentence of the accused
under section 302 was altered to one under section 304, Part I.358. Where the accused
under misapprehension that the deceased came to abduct his daughter attacked the
deceased with a sharp-edged weapon, without pre-meditation, causing only one injury
and he died after three days, conviction of the accused was altered from under section
300 to one under section 304, Part I.359. Where three accused persons assaulted the
deceased, one of the accused gave the fatal blow on the victim's head, the second
accused caused simple injuries on the knee and arm with spear, and the third gave
simple blows, it was held that the first accused was liable to be convicted under
section 304, Part I, and as section 34 was not applicable, the second was convicted
under section 324 and the conviction of the third accused under section 323 was
upheld.360.
Where most of the injuries found on the body of the deceased were external and on
lower legs and on arms, it was held that intention of the accused was to cause grievous
hurt and not murder. Conviction of the accused was altered from sections 304/34, Part
I to sections 325/34.361.
[s 304.5.1] Death essential to attract section 304.—
In Harendra Nath Mandal v State of Bihar the accused caused injury on the head of a
man with back portion of his weapon. The injured survived the injury. Still the accused
was convicted under section 304, Part I. It was held by the Supreme Court that the
accused could not be convicted under section 304 because for the application of
section 304, death must have been caused under any of the circumstances mentioned
in five Exceptions of section 300.362.
[s 304.5.2] Exceeding right of private defence.—
Whenever accused sustains injuries in the same occurrence and when the injuries are
grievous in nature, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to explain the injuries on the
person of the accused. The non-explanation of injuries sustained by the accused may
give rise to a possibility that the accused has acted in self-defence.363. In a murder
case, both the parties sustained injuries in a free fight. The accused received a stab
wound on his right shoulder. No explanation of this injury was given by the prosecution.
It was held that the accused had caused injuries to the deceased in right of private
defence, but that he exceeded his right. He was punished under section 304, Part I and
not under section 302.364. In a dispute over possession of land, persons belong to both
the sides were injured. The accused were in actual possession at the relevant time.
Two of the accused received gunshot injuries. They were held to be entitled to the right
of private defence but they exceeded their right. Conviction of the accused under
sections 302/149 was altered to one under section 304 Part I.365. In a fight between
two groups, the accused fired from a distance killing one person of the other group.
Fighting groups were not close enough so as to apprehend immediate danger to
anybody's life, when the firing took place. It was held that the accused had exceeded
the right of private defence. He was convicted under section 304, Part I.366. Where the
accused received injuries at the hands of the deceased and his party, it was held that
the accused were entitled to the right of private defence but by using heavy cutting
weapons like 'gandasas' and causing serious injuries to the deceased, they had
exceeded the right of private defence and were liable to be punished under section 304,
Part I but not for murder.367.
[s 304.5.3] Sudden quarrel.—
Where as a result of provocation caused in a heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel,
the accused chased the deceased to some distance and then gave the single fatal
blow, it was held that the whole incident was a continuous sequence. Hence, the
conviction of the accused was shifted from under section 300 to under section 304,
Part I.368. Where the accused came to the house at midnight, went to sleep with the
deceased but suddenly a quarrel took place and the death occurred on account of
asphyxia, the incident occurred all of a sudden, without any premeditation, the accused
had not taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner; therefore, his
conviction under section 304, Part I of IPC, 1860 was held proper.369.
[s 304.6] Single blow.—
Where a solitary blow was given with a small wooden yoke on the head of the
deceased, conviction under section 300 was altered to one under section 304, Part
I.370.
[s 304.6.1] Provocation.—
The accused suspected the fidelity of his wife who in turn labelled him as impotent. In
the resulting quarrel, the husband picked up a sharp weapon and struck on her vital
parts causing death. It was held that Exception I to section 300 was attracted and the
accused was punishable under section 304, Part I.371.
[s 304.7] Death after discharging from the hospital.—
The victim received gunshot injury on head. On the condition of the victim becoming
better, he was discharged from the hospital. After two months of the incident, he died
due to septicaemia. It was held that having regard to the fact that the victim survived
for 62 days and that his condition was stable when he was discharged from the
hospital, the Court cannot draw an inference that the intended injury caused was
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death so as to attract clause (3) of
section 300 of IPC, 1860. But as the accused used firearms and fired at the victim on
his head and he had the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause
death, the conviction was altered to section 304, Part I.372.
[s 304.8] Suicide pact.—
The death of the deceased was not premeditated and the act of the accused causing
death of his wife appeared to be in furtherance of the understanding between them to
commit suicide and the consent of the deceased and the act of the accused falls under
Exception 5 of section 300, IPC, 1860.373.
[s 304.9] Civil Disputes.—
In view of the civil disputes between the families, there was a sudden minor verbal
exchange bloated into a sudden physical attack. Several persons of the accused group
wielding weapons attacked the deceased and inflicted two simple injuries; one such
simple injury turned out to be fatal sometime later. There was no intention to cause
death, though the accused had knowledge that the weapon used by him to inflict injury
on the scalp of the deceased might cause death. As there was absence of intention to
cause death or to cause such bodily injury as was likely to cause death, the accused
persons were held guilty for an offence punishable under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860
and not for the offence under section 300, IPC, 1860.374.
[s 304.10] Maximum punishment.—
The maximum punishment that is awardable in case of offence under section 304, Part
II, IPC, 1860 is 10 years. In a case, the accused persons were Police Personnel whose
duty was to act in accordance with law and caused death when the deceased was in
police custody. The accused fudged the General Diary Register of the Police Station to
put up their defence and put up a false plea of alibi. The accused-in-charge of police
station prepared a false memo sending the deceased to the hospital when he was
already dead. The accused persons were found guilty of commission of the offence
under section 304, Part II read with section 34, IPC, 1860 and were convicted under
section 304, Part II read with section 34, IPC, 1860 and were sentenced to suffer RI for
a period of 10 years.375.
[s 304.11] Probation.—
Accused was convicted under sections 304(II)/149, IPC, 1860 and sentenced to three
years' RI. He secured a Doctorate and got employed as Senior Assistant Professor in
the Department of Strategic and Regional Studies, University of Jammu. Keeping in
view his conduct and attainments after his involvement in the matter, justified his
release on probation.376.
[s 304.12] Section 304, Part II when attracted in cases of death caused by
driving.—
In a case where negligence or rashness is the cause of death and nothing more,
section 304A may be attracted, but where the rash or negligent act is preceded with the
knowledge that such act is likely to cause death, section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860 may be
attracted and if such a rash and negligent act is preceded by real intention on the part
of the wrong doer to cause death, offence may be punishable under section 302, IPC,
1860.377. If a person wilfully drives a motor vehicle into the midst of a crowd and
thereby causes death to some person, it will not be a case of mere rash and negligent
driving and the act will amount to culpable homicide. Doing an act with the intent to kill
a person or knowledge that doing an act was likely to cause a person's death is
culpable homicide. When intent or knowledge is the direct motivating force of the act,
section 304A has to make room for the graver and more serious charge of culpable
homicide.378.
[s 304.13] BMW CASE.—
The accused in an inebriated state, after consuming excessive alcohol, was driving the
vehicle without license, in a rash and negligent manner in a high speed which resulted
in the death of six persons. Trial Court convicted the accused under section 304, Part II,
but High Court altered the conviction to section 304A.The Supreme Court held that the
accused had sufficient knowledge that his action was likely to cause death and such
action would, in the facts and circumstances of the case fall under section 304, Part II,
IPC, 1860 and the trial Court has rightly held so.379. In another hit and run case,380.
which killed seven persons and caused injuries to eight persons, the Court held that the
case falls under section 304, Part II and not under section 304A by holding that the
person must be presumed to have had the knowledge that, his act of driving the vehicle
without a licence in a high speed after consuming liquor beyond the permissible limit,
is likely or sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death of the pedestrians
on the road.
[s 304.14] Alteration of Charge from section 304A to section 304, Part II.—
Permissibility.—
Neither of the sides would have been in any manner prejudiced in the trial by framing of
a charge either under section 304A or section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860 except for the fact
that the forum trying the charge might have been different, which by itself, in our
opinion, would not cause any prejudice. This is because at any stage of the trial, it
would have been open to the concerned Court to have altered the charge appropriately
depending on the material that is brought before it in the form of evidence.381.
Permissibility to try and convict a person for the offence punishable under section 304,
Part II, IPC, 1860 and the offence punishable under section 338, IPC, 1860 for a single
act of the same transaction. There is no incongruity, if simultaneous with the offence
under section 304, Part II, a person who has done an act so rashly or negligently
endangering human life or the personal safety of the others and causes grievous hurt
to any person is tried for the offence under section 338, IPC, 1860. In view of the above,
the Court opined that, there is no impediment in law for an offender being charged for
the offence under section 304, Part II IPC, 1860 and also under sections 337 and 338,
IPC, 1860. The two charges under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860 and section 338, IPC,
1860 can legally co-exist in a case of single rash or negligent act where a rash or
negligent act is done with the knowledge of likelihood of its dangerous
consequences.382.
