Aiding escape of, rescuing or harbouring such prisoner.
Whoever knowingly aids or assists any State prisoner or prisoner of war in escaping
from lawful custody, or rescues or attempts to rescue any such prisoner, or harbours
or conceals any such prisoner who has escaped from lawful custody, or offers or
attempts to offer any resistance to the recapture of such prisoner, shall be punished
with 106.[imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.—A State prisoner or prisoner of war, who is permitted to be at large on his
parole within certain limits in 107.[India], is said to escape from lawful custody if he
goes beyond the limits within which he is allowed to be at large.
COMMENT—
Aiding escape, harbouring escapees.—This section uses words more extensive than
those in the two preceding ones which contemplate an escape only from some prison
or actual place of custody. Again in the last two sections the offender is a public
servant; under this section he may be any person. The scope of this section is much
narrower than section 129. This section requires that the rescue or assistance be given
"knowingly".
106. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, section 117 and Sch., for "transportation for life" (w.e.f.
1January1956).
107. The words "British India" have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and
Act 3 of 1951, section 3 and Sch. (w.e.f. 1 April 1951), to read as above.
