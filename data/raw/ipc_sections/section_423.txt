Dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of a dacoity.
Whoever dishonestly receives or retains any stolen property, the possession whereof
he knows or has reason to believe to have been transferred by the commission of

believe to belong or to have belonged to a gang of dacoits, property which he knows
or has reason to believe to have been stolen, shall be punished with 457.
[imprisonment for life], or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to
ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT—
This section was enacted to stamp out the offence of dacoity which was very rampant
when the Code came into force. It refers to persons other than actual dacoits. It
provides the same punishment to a receiver of property obtained in dacoity as to
dacoits themselves. It is apparent from a plain reading of section 412 IPC, 1860, that a
person receiving stolen goods, would be guilty of the offence under section 412 IPC,
1860, if it can further be shown, that the recipient of the goods knew (or had reason to
believe), that the person offering the goods, belonged to a gang of dacoits.458.
[s 412.1] CASES.—
The Supreme Court held in PB Soundankar v State of Maharashtra, in absence of any
evidence to show the appellant was aware, that the silver chips presented to him by
accused were procured by the commission of a dacoity or in the alternative that he
knew (or had reason to believe) that accused belonged to a gang of dacoits the guilt of
the appellant under section 412 IPC, 1860 could not be stated to have been
substantiated in the facts and circumstances of the present case." Hence, the
conviction altered to section 411.459. Where properties looted in a dacoity were found
in the possession of the accused who was the resident of the neighbouring village
within three days of the occurrence, it was held that it could be presumed that he had
known or had reason to believe that the properties were the stolen properties of the
dacoity and as such his conviction under section 412, IPC, 1860, was quite in order.460.
The same principle was upheld by the Supreme Court to say that where property looted
in a dacoity was recovered from the accused very soon after the dacoity, the accused
could not be convicted under section 395 but his conviction under section 412, IPC,
1860, would be quite in order.461. Recovery at the instance of the accused persons of
stolen property shortly after a dacoity has been held by the Supreme Court as sufficient
for a conviction under this section.462.
[s 412.2] Conviction under section 395 and section 412;-
When the accused was convicted of having committed dacoity there could not be any
further conviction under section 412.463. Even though dacoity is proved, conviction
under section 412 is maintainable.464. In Mohan Chetri v State of West Bengal, it was
held that conviction under sections 412 or 411 is not permissible simultaneously with
conviction under sections 395 or 394, as the case may be, in respect of the same
accused.465.

(2008) 11 SCC 709 [LNIND 2008 SC 849] - the Trial Court held that since recovery effected by
the prosecution was not in consonance with law, it could not be said that stolen articles of
dacoity were found from the accused and consequently charge for an offence punishable under
section 412, IPC, 1860 also could not be said to be established. Supreme Court did not interfere
with the order of acquittal.
