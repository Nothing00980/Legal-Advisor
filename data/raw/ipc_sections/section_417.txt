Punishment for criminal breach of trust.
Whoever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with
both.
COMMENT—
The criminal breach of trust would, inter alia, mean using or disposing of the property
by a person who is entrusted with or has otherwise dominion there over. Such an act
must not only be done dishonestly but also in violation of any direction of law or any
contract express or implied relating to carrying out the trust.286. To constitute this
offence there must be dishonest misappropriation by a person in whom confidence is
placed as to the custody or management of the property in respect of which the breach
of trust is charged. The ownership or beneficial interest in the property in respect of
which criminal breach of trust is alleged to have been committed must be in some
person other than the accused and the latter must hold it on account of some person
or in some way for his benefit.287. The offence of criminal breach of trust closely
resembles the offence of embezzlement under the English law. Offences committed by
trustees with regard to trust property fall within the purview of this section.
A partner has undefined ownership along with other partners over all the assets of the
partnership. If he chooses to use any of them for his own purpose he may be
accountable civilly to other partners. But he does not thereby commit any
misappropriation. A partner may have dominion over the partnership property. But
mere dominion is not enough. It must further be shown that his dominion was the
result of entrustment. Thus to prosecute a partner the prosecution must establish that
dominion over the assets or a particular asset of the partnership was by a special
agreement between the parties, entrusted to the accused partner. If in the absence of
such a special agreement a partner receives money belonging to the partnership he
cannot be said to have received it in a fiduciary capacity or in other words cannot be
held to have been entrusted with dominion over partnership properties and without
entrustment there cannot be any criminal breach of trust.288. The Supreme Court has
reiterated that where a partner is entrusted with property under special contract and he
holds that property in a fiduciary capacity, any misappropriation of that property would
amount to criminal breach of trust.289.
[s 406.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires—
(1) Entrusting any person with property or with any dominion over property;
(2) The person entrusted (a) dishonestly misappropriating or converting to his own
use that property; or
(b) Dishonestly using or disposing of that property or wilfully suffering any other
person so to do in violation
(i) of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be
discharged, or
(ii) of any legal contract made touching the discharge of such trust.
This offence consists of any one of four positive acts, namely, misappropriation,
conversion, user, or disposal of property. Neither failure to account for breach of
contract, however dishonest, is actually and by itself the offence of criminal breach of
trust.290.
Sufferance of any loss by the victim is not necessary for leading to a conviction under
the section.291.
The section does not require that the trust should be in furtherance of any lawful
object. Offences committed by trustees with regard to trust property fall within the
purview of this section. Negligence or other misconduct causing the loss of trust
property may make the person entrusted civilly responsible, but will not make him
guilty of criminal breach of trust.
[s 406.2] Criminal misappropriation and criminal breach of trust.—
In criminal misappropriation the property comes into the possession of the offender by
some casualty or otherwise, and he afterwards misappropriates it. In the case of
criminal breach of trust the offender is lawfully entrusted with the property, and he
dishonestly misappropriates the same, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do,
instead of discharging the trust attached to it.
1. 'Being in any manner entrusted with property'.—The words "in any manner" do not
enlarge the term "entrustment" itself and, unless there is entrustment, the transaction in
question cannot be affected by the terms of that section.292. The word 'entrusted' is
not a term of law. In its most general significance all it imports is a handing over of the
possession for some purpose which may not imply the conferring of any proprietary
right at all.293. The natural meaning of 'entrusted' involves that the assured should by
some real and conscious volition have imposed on the person, to whom he delivers the
goods, some species of fiduciary duty.294. The expression "entrustment" carries with it
the implication that the person handing over any property or on whose behalf that
property is handed over to another, continues to be its owner. Further, the person
handing over property must have confidence in the person taking the property so as to
create a fiduciary relationship between them.295.
Once entrustment is proved, the prosecution has not to prove any misappropriation. It
is for the accused to prove in his defence that there was no misappropriation. The
offence becomes proved when it is shown that the money has not been applied to the
purpose for which it was entrusted.296.
[s 406.3] Customary gifts at engagement, etc.—
Gifts in cash or kind which are customarily given at the time of engagement, tilak or
marriage ceremony cannot be regarded as an entrustment of items of dowry. No
complaint can be presented against the donee in respect of such customary
practices.297.
Where a person authorised to collect, delegates his functions to a subordinate of his,
and the latter acts in exercise of such delegated authority, any amount that is paid to
him would constitute 'entrustment' within the meaning of section 405.298.
[s 406.4] 'Property'.—
The word 'property' is used in the Code in a much wider sense than the expression
'movable property'. There is no good reason to restrict the meaning of the word
'property' to movable property only when it is used without any qualification in this
section or other sections of the Penal Code.299. The offence of criminal breach of trust
is committed not only by dishonest conversion, but also by dishonest use or
disposition, and there is nothing in the wording of this section to exempt from the
definition of criminal breach of trust dishonest use of immovable property by the
person entrusted with dominion over it.
In cases of criminal breach of trust a distinction has to be drawn between the person
entrusted with property and one having control or general charge over the property. In
case of the former, if it is found that the property is missing, without further proof, the
person so entrusted will be liable to account for it. In the latter case, that person will be
liable only when it is shown that he misappropriated it or was a party to criminal breach
of trust committed in respect of that property by any other person.300.
2. 'Dishonestly misappropriates'.—A temporary misappropriation may also constitute a
criminal breach of trust. The bank officials in this case made public money available to
a private party contrary to statutory provisions and Departmental instructions. The
dishonest intention was self-evident.301. Terms of section 405 are very wide. They
apply to one who is in any manner entrusted with property or dominion over property.
Section 405 does not require that trust should be in furtherance of any lawful object. It
merely provides that a person commits criminal breach of trust if he dishonestly
misappropriates or converts to his own use the property entrusted to him.302.
[s 406.5] Negligence is not 'Dishonestly'.—
Criminal or dishonest intention is a sine qua non in an offence of criminal breach of
trust. This being so the prosecution has to show that the accused dishonestly
misappropriated or converted to his own use or dishonestly disposed of property
entrusted to him. The prosecution must prove 'entrustment' or 'domino' over the
property with the person proceeded and the person so entrusted has dishonestly
misappropriated or converted that property. Even if the prosecution succeeds in
proving entrustment, it would fail to establish the offence against the accused, if it fails
to prove that he has misappropriated the property entrusted303.
It has been held that a mere error of judgment does not attract criminal liability.304.
[s 406.6] Wilful omission to account.—
Similarly, "in the case of a servant charged with misappropriating the goods of his
master the elements of criminal offence of misappropriation will be established if the
prosecution proves that the servant received the goods, that he was under a duty to
account to his master and had not done so. If the failure to account was due to an
accidental loss the facts being within the servant's knowledge, it is, for him to explain
the loss".305. In JM Desai's case the matter was further clarified by the Supreme Court
to say, "conviction of a person for the offence of criminal breach of trust may not in all
cases be founded merely on his failure to account for the property entrusted to him, or
over which he has dominion, even when a duty to account is imposed upon him, but
where he is unable to account or renders an explanation for his failure to account
which is untrue an inference of misappropriation with dishonest intent may readily be
made".306.
Mere retention of goods by a person without misappropriation does not constitute
criminal breach of trust.307.
3. 'Dishonestly uses or disposes of that property'.— To constitute the offence of
criminal breach of trust punishable under section 406 of the IPC, 1860, there must be
dishonest misappropriation by a person in whom confidence is placed as to the
custody or management of the property in respect of which the breach of trust is
charged. The misappropriation or conversion or disposal must be with a dishonest
intention. Every breach of trust gives rise to a suit for damages, but it is only when there
is evidence of a mental act of fraudulent misappropriation that the commission of
embezzlement of any sum of money becomes a penal offence punishable as criminal
breach of trust. It is this mental act of fraudulent misappropriation that clearly
demarcates an act of embezzlement which is a civil wrong or tort, from the offence of
criminal breach of trust. In the present case, apparently the prosecution has failed to
establish the offence of cheating and criminal breach of trust in the absence of mens
rea. In such view of the matter, the accused persons could not have been convicted.308.
3A. In violation of any direction of law.—The criminal breach of trust would, inter alia,
mean using or disposing of the property by a person who is entrusted with or has
otherwise dominion there over. Such an act must not only be done dishonestly but also
in violation of any direction of law or any contract express or implied relating to
carrying out the trust. A direction of law need not be a law made by the Parliament or a
Legislature; it may be made by an authority having the power therefor; the law could be
a subordinate legislation, a notification or even a custom.309. It has been held that the
expression "direction of law", even if taken literally, would include a direction issued by
authorities in exercise of their statutory power as also power of supervision. Failure on
the part of bank officials to follow RBI instructions and provisions of a Departmental
Manual was a violation of a direction of law amounting to criminal breach of trust. The
Manual was the UCO Bank Manual of Instructions on Bill Discounting.310.
It has been held that the expression "direction of law" in section 405 includes banking
norms, practices and directions given in internal Departmental instructions of a bank.
Bank officials who allowed advance credits on banker's cheques to a customer in
violation of Departmental instructions acted in violation of direction of law. The
officials had dominion over the money belonging to the bank and they dishonestly used
that money for conferring a benefit on the customer. They were held guilty of the
offence under the section.311.
[s 406.7] Partner.—
In Velji Raghavji,312. the Supreme Court approved this statement of law in Bhuban
MohanRana v Surendra Mohan Das, and held that mere existence of the accused's
dominion over property is not enough and that it must be further shown that his
dominion was the result of entrustment. According to the Supreme Court the
prosecution must establish that dominion over the assets or a particular asset of the
partnership was by a special agreement between the parties, entrusted to the accused
partner. Where the partner of a firm had taken away some VCRs and cassettes, a
criminal complaint was not allowed, the loss to the firm being essentially of civil nature
and, therefore, civil proceedings would have been more appropriate.313. Signing of
contracts on behalf of the firm particularly when the partnership deed authorised
partners to sign documents on behalf of others was held to be not constituting a
criminal breach of trust.314. As to when can a partner be prosecuted on a charge of
criminal breach of trust see "Comments" ante.
[s 406.8] Misappropriation of company money by nominated director.—
The accused was the director of a public limited company and in that capacity he
misappropriated a huge sum of money. In the complaint against him the charge was
made out under section 409. However, the charge was framed under section 408. It
was held that the accused was a nominated director of the company and there was
nothing to indicate that he was an employee or servant of the company. Hence, his
conviction under section 408 was not to be legally sound. He was convicted under
section 406.315.
[s 406.9] Directors of company.—
The directors of a company were prosecuted for non-deposit of PF amount of
employees. It was held that directors are not in the position of the principal employer.
They could not be prosecuted as there was no entrustment of the amount to them in
terms of section 405, explanation 1.316. The offence alleged in the criminal complaint
filed by respondent is under sections 405 and 420 IPC, 1860 where under no specific
liability is imposed on the officers of the company, if the alleged offence is by the
Company. In the absence of specific details about the same, no person other than
Company can be prosecuted under the alleged complaint.317.
The complainant was the wholesale dealer of the company. His dealership was
terminated. Even so he sent a demand draft to the company for supply of goods. He
did so because his dealership was subsequently reinstated by the company. The
proprietor of the dealer firm filed a complaint alleged offence by the company because
neither it supplied the goods nor returned the money. The company's application for
quashing the complaint was rejected because the offence was prima facie made out.
The Supreme Court said that only the company could be made liable but not its
managing director or any other employee. The Supreme Court reversed the order of the
High Court. Costs and compensation of harassment was quantified at Rs. 1,00,000.318.
[s 406.10] Husband and Wife.—
The Supreme Court has held that reading this section with sections 4 and 6 of the
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, marriage gifts and ornaments received from in-laws must
be handed over to the wife on being driven out and a failure to do so, would amount to
an offence under this section.319. Where the wife was turned out of the house by the
husband who refused to return the 'streedhan' despite repeated requests and
persuasions, it was held that criminal breach of trust is a continuing offence and fresh
cause of action accrues to the wife till the return of the property.320.
It has been held that taking away by the mother-in-law of gifts and cash offerings to the
wife at the time of her marriage amounts to misappropriation of streedhan. It was
further held that offering of 25 lakh rupees for grant of divorce by mutual consent as
compensation to the complainant did not per se constitute any offence under the
section. Any gift made to the bridegroom or her parents, whether in accordance with
any custom or law also did not constitute an offence under the section. The
proceedings were directed to be continued only against the mother-in-law.321.
[s 406.11] Pledgee.—
where, in derogation of the statutory requirement of giving reasonable notice before
disposing of the articles pledged, the pledgee sells them and the price obtained is also
not commensurate with the real value of the goods, the Delhi High Court expressed the
opinion that it may amount to criminal breach of trust.322.
[s 406.12] Vehicle delivered under hire-purchase.—
When hirer himself committed default by not paying the instalments and under the
agreement, the appellants have repossessed the vehicle, the respondent-hirer cannot
have any grievance as the vital element of 'dishonest intention' is lacking. The element
of 'dishonest intention' which is an essential element to constitute the offence of theft
cannot be attributed to a person exercising his right under an agreement entered into
between the parties as he may not have an intention of causing wrongful gain or to
cause wrongful loss to the hirer.323.Where a person to whom a truck was delivered
under hire-purchase scheme, altered the identity of the vehicle by tampering with
numbers, it was held that an offence under section 406 was made out. The accused
was convicted to four years R1.324.
[s 406.13] Default in refunding share application money.—
A person, who makes a public issue for inviting applications for shares and who
becomes liable to refund the share application money because of refusal by a stock
exchange to approve his securities and fails to refund the money, can be prosecuted for
criminal breach of trust.325.
[s 406.14] Money saving scheme.—
The petitioner was running money saving scheme. He used to collect money from the
members for different committees and disbursement to them. The disbursement was
stopped because of non-payment by members of the amount due. It was held that
there was no dishonest intention to misappropriate money and offences under
sections 406 and 420 were not made out.326.
[s 406.15] Re-payment of loan.—
Where the accused sold machinery and goods which had been hypothecated to bank
and the amount not paid to bank for repayment of loan, Court held that dispute in
question is of civil nature and the trial Court justified in dismissing complaint under
section 203.327.
4. 'Legal contract express or implied'.—Violation of a contract in order to amount to
criminal breach of trust has to be in respect of a legal or valid contract, and not one for
a criminal purpose, e.g., purchase of stolen property, etc.328.
[s 406.16] CASES.—Breach of trust.—
Where a retired employee of a company wrongly occupied the Company quarters for
more than 18 years, dismissal of complaint under section 630 Companies Act, 2013
and section 406 IPC, 1860 on technical grounds by the magistrate was held
untenable.329. The complaint does not contain the averment that Rs.5 lakhs was
entrusted to the appellant, either in his personal capacity or as the Chairman of MSEB
and that he misappropriated it for his own use. The said amount was deposited by the
complainant company with MSEB and there is nothing in the complaint which may
even remotely suggest that the complainant had entrusted any property to appellant or
that the appellant had dominion over the said money of the complainant, which was
converted by him to his own use, so as to satisfy the ingredients of section 405 IPC,
1860. Proceedings quashed.330. Where the accused took a jeep on loan for a specific
purpose and for a particular period but refused to return it on demand by the
complainant after the purpose had been served and the stipulated period was long
over, it was held that there was a prima facie case of criminal breach of trust and as
such the complaint could not be thrown out.331.
[s 406.17] Refusal to return streedhan.—
Where the husband and the father-in-law turned out a Hindu woman from the marital
home and refused to return her ornaments, money and clothes despite repeated
demands, it was held that an offence of criminal breach of trust as defined in sections
405 and 406, IPC, 1860, was prima facie made out and the case could not be quashed.
Section 27 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and section 14 of the Hindu Succession
Act, 1956, nowhere provide that the concept of streedhan is abolished or that a remedy
under the criminal law is not available.332.
[s 406.18] Violation of legal contract.—
where there is a mere breach of the contract terms, such as default in payment of an
instalment, a liability of civil nature only would arise.333. Where a contractor was given
cement for construction work by the Minor Irrigation Department, Government of Bihar
under a specific agreement that he would return unused cement but instead of doing
so he sold the cement to outsiders, it was held a fiduciary relationship had been clearly
established in the instant case and the contractor was liable to be convicted under
section 406, IPC, 1860.334.
[s 406.19] Acting contrary to directions of person entrusting money.—
One of the accused persons, a registered stock broker, purchased mutual fund
securities in the name of a bank and later on sold them. The sale was contrary to the
terms subject to which securities were issued (sale before completion of lock-in
period). But otherwise there was no violation of any statutory provisions. Neither the
name lending bank nor the issuing institution objected to the sale. It was held that the
accused was the real owner of the securities. There was no breach of trust on his part
because the property sold was his own. The securities were purchased by another
financial institution and the other accused was an officer of that institution. He was
also acquitted of similar charges. He could not be convicted under the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 for the reason that purchase of securities to the tune of 33 crores
could not have been done without authorisation from higher authorities. The
transaction was also legal.335.
[s 406.20] Civil wrong when becomes crime.—
A distinction must be made between a civil wrong and a criminal wrong. When dispute
between the parties constitute only a civil wrong and not a criminal wrong, the Courts
would not permit a person to be harassed although no case for taking cognizance of
the offence has been made out336. An act of breach of trust simpliciter involves a civil
wrong of which the person wronged may seek his redress for damages in a civil Court
but a breach of trust with mens rea gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well. The
element of 'dishonest intention' is therefore, an essential element to constitute the
offence of Criminal Breach of Trust.337. Breach of trust may be basically a civil wrong,
but it gives rise to criminal liability also when there is mens rea.338. The difference
between the two lies in dishonest intention.339. If there is a flavour of civil nature, the
same cannot be agitated in the form of criminal proceeding. If there is huge delay and
in order to avoid the period of limitation, it cannot be resorted to a criminal
proceeding.340. A civil suit was filed alleging negligence and breach of contractual
obligations. The Court said that a breach of contract simpliciter does not constitute any
offence. The criminal complaint must disclose the ingredients of the offence. For
ascertaining the prima facie correctness of the allegations the Court can look at the
correspondence between the parties and other admitted documents. Criminal
proceedings should not be encouraged when they are found to be mala fide or
otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.341. Merely because a civil claim has
been raised by the complainant regarding the breach of agreement, it cannot prevent
him from initiating criminal proceedings.342. Though a case of breach of trust may be
both a civil wrong and a criminal offence but there would be certain situations where it
would predominantly be a civil wrong and may or may not amount to a criminal
offence. The present case is one of that type where, if at all, the facts may constitute a
civil wrong and the ingredients of the criminal offences are wanting. Having regard to
the relevant documents including the trust deed as also the correspondence following
the creation of the tenancy, the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties, the
natural relationship between the settlor and the trustee as mother and son and the fall
out in their relationship and the fact that the wife of the co-trustee was no more
interested in the tenancy, it must be held that the criminal case should not be
continued.343.
[s 406.20.1] Matters under special laws.—
The act of taking away dowry articles by the husband and in-laws, being in violation of
special legislation contained in the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, such offence should
be tried under the special legislation rather than under the general provisions of IPC,
1860. The Supreme Court also pointed out that if any article was given by way of
dowry, the question of its entrustment on behalf of wife would not arise.344.
[s 406.21] Arbitration clause.—
The presence of an arbitration clause between the parties does not bar criminal
proceedings under section 406. Both civil and criminal proceedings can be there side
by side.345.
[s 406.22] Period of Limitation.—
The Punjab and Haryana High Court is of the view that the offence under the section is
of continuing nature. Every day a fresh cause of action keeps accruing until the
property is actually returned.346.
[s 406.23] Sanction for prosecution.—
In a charge against a Government servant under the section read with section 120B
(conspiracy), sanction for prosecution is not necessary.347. Since transaction for
offences involved took place in a foreign country, sanction from Central Government is
a must to enable Court to take cognizance of offences and proceed further in case.
The High Court held that trial has proceeded without sanction and, thus, rendering it
invalid, and in course of such invalid trial magistrate passed order for further
investigation, which too was invalid.348.
[s 406.24] Compromise.
Compounding was denied on the ground that section 406 not compoundable as
amount involved was more than Rs. 250. The Supreme Court held that it is perhaps
advisable that in disputes where the question involved is of a purely personal nature,
the Court should ordinarily accept the terms of the compromise even in criminal
proceedings as keeping the matter alive with no possibility of a result in favour of the
prosecution is a luxury which the Courts, grossly overburdened as they are, cannot
afford and that the time so saved can be utilized in deciding more effective and
meaningful litigation. This is a common sense approach to the matter based on ground
of realities and bereft of the technicalities of the law.349.
[s 406.25] Jurisdiction.—
The Streedhan was handed over at one place and misappropriated at another place. It
was held that there was no jurisdiction at the place where it was entrusted because at
that time there might have been no intention to misappropriate. Thus jurisdiction was
only at the place where misappropriation was committed.350.
[s 406.25.1] Entrustment of cheque.—
A cheque has been held to be a property within the meaning of section 405. A blank
cheque was issued to a person who misappropriated the same or used it for a purpose
for which it was not given. The case under section 406 was held to have been made
out.351.
[s 406.26] Dishonour of cheque.—
There were regular business dealings in the course of which payments were made by
cheques. One such cheque was dishonoured for which the criminal complaint was
instituted. There was nothing in the complaint to show that the intention was to cheat
the complainant by giving him the cheque as a camouflage. The transaction under
which the cheque was given was a mere agreement to sell without any actual transfer
of goods. Thus the offence of cheating or of criminal breach of trust was not made out.
The complaint was quashed.352.

346. Balram Singh v Sukhwant Kaur, 1992 Cr LJ 972 (P&H). The court surveyed a number of

1688 [LNIND 1984 SC 377] : 1984 Lab IC 1578 , wherein the Supreme Court explained the
concept of a continuing offence. Best v Butter, (1932) 2 KB 108 , wherein it was held under the
Trade Unions Act that every day that the moneys were willfully withheld, the offence was
committed. The court noted the contrary view expressed in Waryam Singh v State of Punjab,
1982 Cr LJ (NOC) 117 (P&H) and State of Punjab v Sarwan Singh, 1981 Cr LJ 722 (SC) : 1981
PLR 451 : AIR 1981 SC 1054 [LNIND 1981 SC 201] , but distinguished them because there in the

Recent CR 424 it was again taken for granted without argument that the offence under the
section was not of continuing nature.
