State Amendment
Tamil Nadu.—The following amendments were made by Tamil Nadu Act No. 28 of 1993,
Section 2.
Section 380 of the Indian Penal Code (Central Act XLV of 1860) (hereinafter in this Part
referred to as the principal Act), shall be renumbered as sub-section (1) of that section
and after sub-section (1) as so renumbered, the following sub-section shall be added,
namely:—
"(2) Whoever commits theft in respect of any idol or icon in any building used as a
place of worship 'shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall
not be less than two years but which may extend to three years and with fine which
shall not be less than two thousand rupees:
Provided that the court may, for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the
judgment impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than two years."
COMMENT—
The object of the section is to give greater security to property deposited in a house,
tent or vessel. Theft from a person in a dwelling house will be simple theft under
section 379.91.
1. 'Theft in any building'.—Building means a permanent edifice of some kind. Theft
should, under the section, have been committed in any such building. Theft from a
veranda,92. or the top of a house,93. or a brake-van,94. is not theft in a building. But
where the accused stole some luggage and cash from a railway carriage, when it was
at a railway station, it was held that though the railway carriage was not a building, the
railway station was, and the accused was therefore, guilty under this section.95. An
entrance hall surrounded by a wall in which there were two doorways but no doors,
which was used for custody of property, was held to be a building.96. A courtyard97. is,
but a compound98. is not, a building. Merely on basis of having possession of some
stolen articles, accused cannot be held to be guilty of offences punishable under
sections 450 and 380.99.
[s 380.1] CASES.—
The only evidence against accused is the alleged recovery of gold chain at his instance.
That cannot connect the appellant to the theft.100. The accused persons were
suspected to have committed some offences of house-breaking and on being
interrogated they voluntarily disclosed some places where they had committed house-
breaking in respect of gold ornaments and then they disclosed the shop of a goldsmith
to whom they had sold the gold and silver ornaments. It was held that their conviction,
based merely on uncorroborated evidence as to recovery of stolen property at their
instance, was highly unsafe. Accordingly, their conviction under sections 380 and 457
was set aside.101. In a case involving theft of an idol, the guilt of the accused could not
be proved by circumstantial evidence. The confession of the co-accused was not
voluntary. Acquittal of the accused was held to be justified.102.
[s 380.2] House breaking and Theft.—
Offence under section 454 also includes section 380. In view of the conviction for
section 454 of the IPC, 1860, separate conviction for the offence under section 380 of
the IPC, 1860 is not needed.103.
[s 380.3] Punishment.—
The accused was poor and rustic villager. He was the only bread winner of the family.
He was not a previous convict. He had already faced trial for seven years. The order
releasing him after due admonition was held to be proper.104.
[s 380.4] Sentences in different cases can run concurrently.—
The Supreme Court, in Benson v State of Kerala,105. examined whether an accused, who
is sentenced to undergo different periods of sentences punished in different cases
should undergo the imprisonment consecutively or can undergo concurrently, and held
that in terms of sub-section (1) of section 427 Cr PC, 1973, if a person already
undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is sentenced on a subsequent conviction to
imprisonment, such subsequent term of imprisonment would normally commence at
the expiration of the imprisonment to which he was previously sentenced, however, this
normal Rule is subject to a qualification and it is within the powers of the Court to
direct that the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with the previous sentence.
[s 380.5] Probation.—
Taking note of the age of accused which is put at 20 years, he could be given the
benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958.106.

conviction set aside because of doubtful recovery. The accused was employed in the house of
the deceased. He was removed but reemployed in the factory of the deceased. This fact had to
be excluded because it was not put to him during his examination under section 313, Cr PC,
1973. The accused being a domestic help, the presence of his fingerprints in the household
articles was natural and not of any special significance. He was not the only person employed
the deceased being in the habit of changing servants.

went to police station. But two of them were acquitted. Conviction of the rest of them was
altered from section 395 to one under section 392, (punishment for robbery). Raju v State of
