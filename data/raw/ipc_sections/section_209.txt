Fraudulent removal or concealment of property to prevent its seizure as
forfeited or in execution.
Whoever fraudulently removes, conceals, transfers or delivers to any person any
property or any interest therein, intending thereby to prevent that property or interest
therein from being taken as a forfeiture or in satisfaction of a fine, under a sentence
which has been pronounced, or which he knows to be likely to be pronounced, by a
Court of Justice or other competent authority, or from being taken in execution of a
decree or order which has been made, or which he knows to be likely to be made by a
Court of Justice in a civil suit, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
The concealment or removal of property contemplated in this section must be to
prevent the property from being taken. Where the property is already taken and the
removal is subsequent, the offence under this section is not committed.210. The word
'taken' has been used in the sense of 'seized' or 'taken possession of'.211. Where the
removal was open and without any element of secrecy or deception, it was held that
the removal was not "fraudulent removal" and hence this section could not apply.212.
A creditor commits no fraud who anticipates other creditors and obtains a discharge of
his debt by the assignment of any property which has not already been attached by
another creditor.213.
Sections 206, 207 and 208 have the effect of rendering criminal all collusive modes by
which creditors, or lawful claimants may be defeated of their just remedies. Sections
421–424 deal with fraudulent transfers.
Under this and the next section a civil suit must be actually pending before a Court, and
not merely intended to be filed.214.
