Lingana bin Giubana, 4 Bombay High Court Rep. C.C. 14) to declare expressly that a person who, through neglect, permits a public road to be damaged by allowing his pigs to trespass thereon, is liable to be fined. The cases of Reg. v. Mir Saheb Kassamia,1 Bombay High Court Rep. 100; Reg. v. Mathur Purshottam, 4 ib, C.P. 13; and Reg. v. Ganga Kom Mhasu, 516 C.C. 13 have also been carefully considered.
