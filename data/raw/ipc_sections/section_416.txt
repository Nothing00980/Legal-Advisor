COMMENT—
The basic requirement to bring home the accusations under section 405 are the
requirements to prove conjointly i) entrustment and ii) whether the accused was
actuated by dishonest intention or not, misappropriated it or converted it to his own
use to the detriment of the persons who entrusted it.282. Two distinct parts are
involved in the commission of the offence of criminal breach of trust. The first part
consists of the creation of an obligation in relation to the property over which dominion
or control is acquired by the accused. The second is the misappropriation or dealing
with the property dishonestly and contrary to the terms of the obligation created.283. A
trust contemplated by section 405 would arise only when there is an entrustment of
property or dominion over property. There has, therefore, to be a property belonging to
someone which is entrusted to the person accused of the offence under section 405.
The entrustment of property creates a trust which is only an obligation annexed to the
ownership of the property and arises out of a confidence reposed and accepted by the
owner.284. However, it must be borne in mind that section 405 IPC, 1860 does not
contemplate the creation of a trust with all the technicalities of the law of trust. It
contemplates the creation of a relationship whereby the owner of property makes it
over to another person to be retained by him until a certain contingency arises or to be
disposed of by him on the happening of a certain event.285.
