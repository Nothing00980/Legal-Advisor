Mischief with intent to destroy or make unsafe a decked vessel or one
of twenty tons burden.
Whoever commits mischief to any decked vessel or any vessel of a burden of twenty
tons or upwards, intending to destroy or render unsafe, or knowing it to be likely that
he will thereby destroy or render unsafe, that vessel, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENTâ€”
The vessel must be a 'decked vessel' or a 'vessel of a burden of twenty tons or
upwards'. This limitation is laid down to exclude small craft of all kinds. The intention
of the Legislature is to punish mischief committed on vessels which are likely to carry
passengers.
