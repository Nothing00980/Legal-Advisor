Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act, 1878
(41 and 42 VICT., C 73)
Last Updated 26th July, 2019
[Dated 16.8.1878.]
An act to regulate the law relating to the trial of offences committed on the sea within a certain distance of the Coasts of Her Majesty's Dominions.
Whereas the rightful jurisdiction of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, extends and has always extended over the open seas adjacent to the coasts of the United Kingdom and of all other parts of Her Majesty's dominions to such a distance as is necessary for the defence and security of such dominions :
And Whereas it is expedient that all offences committed on the open sea within a certain distance of the coasts of the United Kingdom and of all other parts of Her Majesty's dominions, by whomsoever committed, should be dealt with according to law :
Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords Spiritual and Temporal, and commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :
1.
 Short title.


- This Act may be cited as The Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act, 1878.
2.
 Amendment of the law as to the jurisdiction of the Admiral.


- An offence committed by a person, whether he is or is not a subject of Her Majesty, on the open sea within the territorial waters of Her Majesty's dominions, is an offence within the jurisdiction of the Admiral although it may, have been committed on board or by means of a foreign ship and the person who committed such offence may be arrested, tried, and punished accordingly.
Note. - In respect of this Act the Law Commission of India has made the following observation :
"This statute empowers the Admiralty in England or in any of the British Dominions to have jurisdiction over any offence committed within the "territorial waters" of the U.K. or of a Dominion as the case may be, - even though the offence may have been committed by a foreign national or on board a foreign ship.
The territorial waters being a part of the territory of State, India is competent to enact a law of her own defining the limits of its territorial waters." - Fifth Report, dated 11-5-1957.
3.
 Restriction on institution of proceedings for punishment of offence.


- Proceedings for the trial and punishment of a person who is not a subject of Her Majesty, and who is charged with any such offence as is declared by this Act to be within the jurisdiction of the Admiral, shall not be instituted in any Court of the United Kingdom, except with the consent of one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, and on his certificate that the institution of such proceedings is in, his opinion expedient, and shall not be instituted in any of the dominions of Her Majesty out of the United Kingdom except with the leave of the Governor of the part of dominions in which such proceedings are proposed to be instituted, and on his certificate that it is expedient that such proceedings should be instituted.
4.
 Provisions as to procedure.


- On the trial of any person who is not a subject of Her Majesty for an offence declared by this Act to be within the jurisdiction of the Admiral, it shall not be necessary to aver in any indictment or information on such trial that such consent or certificate of the Secretary of State or Governor as is required by this Act has been given, and the fact of the same having been given shall be presumed unless disputed by the defendant at the trial, and the production of a document purporting to be signed by one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State as respects the United Kingdom, and by the Governor as respects any other part of Her Majesty's dominions, and containing such consent and certificate, shall be sufficient evidence for all the purposes of this Act of the consent and certificate required by this Act.
Proceedings before a justice of the peace or other Magistrate previous to the committal of an offender for trial or to the determination of the justice or Magistrate that the offender is to be put upon his trial shall not be deemed proceedings for the trial of the offence committed by such offender for the purposes of the said consent and certificate under this Act.
5.
 Saving as to jurisdiction.


- Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed to be in derogation of any rightful jurisdiction of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, under the law of nations, or to affect or prejudice any jurisdiction conferred by Act of Parliament or now by law existing in relation to foreign ships or in relation to persons on board such ships.
6.
 Saving as to piracy.


- This Act shall not prejudice or affect the trial in manner heretofore in use of any act of piracy as defined by the law of nations, or affect or prejudice any law relating thereto; and where any act of piracy as defined by the law of nations is also any such offence as is declared by this Act to be within the jurisdiction of the Admiral, such offence may be tried in pursuance of this Act, or in pursuance of any other Act of Parliament, law, or custom relating thereto.
