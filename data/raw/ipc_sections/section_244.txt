Delivery of coin as genuine, which, when first possessed, the deliverer
did not know to be counterfeit.
Whoever delivers to any other person as genuine, or attempts to induce any other
person to receive as genuine, any counterfeit coin which he knows to be counterfeit,
but which he did not know to be counterfeit at the time when he took it into his
possession, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to two years, or with fine to an amount which may extend to ten
times the value of the coin counterfeited, or with both.
ILLUSTRATION
A, a coiner, delivers counterfeit Company's rupees to his accomplice B, for the purpose
of uttering them. B sells the rupees to C, another utterer, who buys them knowing them
to be counterfeit. C pays away the rupees for goods to D, who receives them, not
knowing them to be counterfeit. D, after receiving the rupees, discovers that they are
counterfeit and pays them away as if they were good. Here D is punishable only under
this section, but B and C are punishable under section 239 or 240, as the case may be.
COMMENT.â€”
This section applies to a casual utterer of base coins. Section 239 deals with
professional utterers.
