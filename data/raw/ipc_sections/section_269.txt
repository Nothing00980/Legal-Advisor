COMMENT.â€”
This section punishes a person who is in possession of a false weight or measure just
as sections 235, 239 and 240 punish a person who is in possession of a counterfeit
coin, and section 259 punishes a person who is in possession of a counterfeit stamp.
A measure is false if it is something other than what it purports to be. If both the
purchaser and seller are aware of the actual measure being used, there is no fraudulent
intent as required by this section. It is only when the seller purports to sell according to
a certain standard, and sells below that standard, that he can be said to be guilty of
fraud.4.
The mere possession of false weights or measures will not in itself raise any strong
presumption of fraud. It is necessary to show that the accused knew the scales to be
false and intended to use them fraudulently.5.
