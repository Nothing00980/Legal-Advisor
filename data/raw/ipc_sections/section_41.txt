When such an act is criminal by reason of its being done with a criminal
knowledge or intention.
Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal
knowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in
the act with such knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if
the act were done by him alone with that knowledge or intention.
COMMENTâ€”
The preceding section provided for a case in which a criminal act was done by several
persons in furtherance of the common intention of all. Under this section several
persons who actually perform the act must be shown to have the particular intent or
knowledge, if the act is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal
knowledge or intention. If several persons, having one and the same criminal intention
or knowledge, jointly commit murder or an assault, each is liable for the offence as if he
has acted alone; but if several persons join in an act, each having a different intention
or knowledge from the others, each is liable according to his own criminal intention or
knowledge, and he is not liable further. If an act which is an offence in itself and
without reference to any criminal knowledge or intention on the part of the doers is
done by several persons, each of such persons is liable for the offence.
Neither section 34 nor this section provides that those who take part in the act are
jointly liable for the same offence. They merely provide that each of the performers
shall be liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. In
this section also, the responsibility is shared by each offender individually if the act
which is criminal only by reason of certain criminal knowledge or intention is done by
each person sharing that knowledge or intention.265. A mere look at that section shows
that if the act alleged against these accused becomes criminal on account of their
sharing common knowledge about the defective running of Plant at Bhopal by the
remaining accused who represented them on the spot and who had to carry out their
directions from them and who were otherwise required to supervise their activity.
Section 35 of the Indian Penal Code could at least prima facie be invoked against
accused 2, 3, 4 and 12 to be read with section 304-A Indian Penal Code.266.
