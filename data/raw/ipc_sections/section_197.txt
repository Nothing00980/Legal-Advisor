COMMENT.—
This is an aggravated form of the offence of giving or fabricating false evidence made
punishable by section 193.
To constitute an offence under this section the accused must give false evidence
intending thereby to cause some person to be convicted of a capital offence. A person
who brings before a Court a witness whom he has tutored to tell a false story
concerning a murder case before it, commits an offence under this section.99.

large number of documents to get the accused persons convicted and the time was

with the help of two sarpanchas and villagers to rope in an innocent man in a false
murder case which led to his conviction by the Sessions Court and during the course of
hearing of the appeal in the High Court the so-called murdered man appeared in person
before the High Court, it was held that the Inspector, the sarpanchas and the other
witnesses were liable to be prosecuted under section 194, IPC, 1860, read with section
