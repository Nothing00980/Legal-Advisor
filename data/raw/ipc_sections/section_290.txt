COMMENT.â€”
Machinery is dangerous to human life if proper precaution is not taken in its working.
This section renders any rash or negligent conduct in respect of machinery punishable.
Section 284 deals with poison; section 285, with fire or combustible matter, section
286, with explosive substance; and this section, with machinery.
Death of the victim occurred when his hand got crushed in conveyor belt while
repairing it. There is no evidence to prove that the accused knowingly or negligently
failed to take precautions against probable danger. It is held that no offence under
section 287 or section 304A is made out.90.
