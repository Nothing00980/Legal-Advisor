Grievous hurt.
The following kinds of hurt only are designated as "grievous":
First.—Emasculation.
Secondly.—Permanent privation of the sight of either eye.
Thirdly.—Permanent privation of the hearing of either ear,
Fourthly.—Privation of any member or joint.
Fifthly.—Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint.
Sixthly.—Permanent disfiguration of the head or face.
Seventhly.—Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth.
Eighthly.—Any hurt which endangers life or which causes the sufferer to be during the
space of twenty days in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.
COMMENT.—
Grievous hurt is hurt of a more serious kind. This section merely gives the description
of grievous hurt.
The authors of the Code observe:
We have found it very difficult to draw a line between those bodily hurts which are serious
and those which are slight. To draw such a line with perfect accuracy is, indeed, absolutely
impossible; but it is far better that such a line should be drawn, though rudely, than that
offences some of which approach in enormity to murder, while others are little more than
frolics which a good-natured man would hardly resent, would be classed together.717.
To make out the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, there must be some
specific hurt, voluntarily inflicted, and coming within any of the eight kinds enumerated
in this section. Where the injury was caused on the abdomen with a sharp-edged
weapon and the doctor stated that the injury was penetrating into the abdominal cavity
touching the interior surface of the stomach, not involving any important structure or
organ involving danger to life, it was held that the accused had caused simple hurt and
not grievous hurt.718. A person cannot be said to have caused grievous hurt unless the
hurt caused is one of the kinds of hurt specified under section 320, IPC, 1860.
Therefore, it is the duty of the Court to give a finding on its own whether the hurt was
simple or grievous. The Court is not concerned with the classification made by a doctor
as to whether the hurt was simple or grievous. A doctor is to describe the facts in
respect of the nature of injury and the Court is to decide whether the nature of the
injury described by the doctor comes within any of the clauses of section 320, IPC,
1860.719.
[s 320.1] Clause 1.—
'Emasculation' means depriving a male of masculine vigour.
[s 320.2] Clause 6.—Disfigurement of head or face.—
Disfiguration means doing a man some external injury which detracts from his personal
appearance but does not weaken him, as the cutting of a man's nose or ears. Where a
girl's cheeks were branded with a red-hot iron which left scars of a permanent
character, it was held that the disfigurement contemplated by this section was
caused.720.
[s 320.3] Clause 7.—Fracture, dislocation bone, tooth.—
For the application of this clause it is not necessary that a bone should be cut through
and through or that the crack must extend from the outer to the inner surface or that
there should be displacement of any fragment of the bone. If there is a break by cutting
or splintering of the bone or there is a rupture or fissure in it, it would amount to a
fracture within the meaning of this clause.721. It has been held that a mere partial cut
of the bone amounts to fracture and is, therefore, a grievous injury within the meaning
of section 320 (Seventhly).722.
[s 320.4] Clause 8.—Endangering life, severe bodily pain, etc.—
This clause speaks of two things: (1) any hurt which endangers life, and (2) any hurt
which causes the sufferer to be during the space of 20 days (a) in severe bodily pain, or
(b) unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. Some hurts which are not like those hurts
which are mentioned in the first seven clauses, are obviously distinguished from a
slight hurt, may nevertheless be more serious. Thus, a wound may cause intense pain,
prolonged disease or lasting injury to the victim, although it does not fall within any of
the first seven clauses. Before a conviction for the sentence of grievous hurt can be
passed, one of the injuries defined in section 320 must be strictly proved, and the
eighth clause is no exception to the general rule of law that a penal statute must be
construed strictly.723.
The line between culpable homicide not amounting to murder and grievous hurt is a
very thin line. In the one case the injuries must be such as are likely to cause death; in
the other, the injuries must be such as to endanger life.724.
An injury can be said to endanger life if it is in itself that it may put the life of the injured
in danger.725.
The mere fact that a man has been in hospital for 20 days is not sufficient; it must be
proved that during that time he was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.726. Where
the accused caused hurt to a woman who remained in hospital only for 17 days, out of
which she was in danger for three days, it was held that he had caused grievous
hurt.727. A disability for 20 days constitutes grievous hurt: if it continues for a smaller
period, then the offence is hurt.728. The two accused persons tied their victim to an
electric pole and assaulted him only to teach him a lesson for spreading scandalous
information about the alleged love affair of the accused. Their victim died. There was
no evidence to attribute any particular overt act to any of them, nor of the intention of
any of them to cause death or that any of them was armed with a deadly weapon. It
was held that their offence fell within this clause because they endangered the life of
their victim and not under section 300 (murder).729. Where the accused persons, after
raping a girl of 11 years, thrust a stick into her private part and she died of injuries
thereby caused, it was held that while the accused could be convicted under this
clause, in the absence of evidence that the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course
of nature to cause death, they could not be convicted under section 302.730.
[s 320.5] Acts neither intended nor likely to cause death may amount to
grievous hurt even though death is caused.—
Where there is no intention to cause death or no knowledge that death is likely to be
caused from the harm inflicted, and death is caused, the accused would be guilty of
grievous hurt if the injury caused was of a serious nature, but not of culpable homicide.
Where the only intention of the accused who was convicted for the offence of murder
was to steal the jewels of the deceased and the only violence which he committed, viz.,
cutting the nostrils of the deceased, was necessary in order to facilitate the theft and
the death of the deceased was entirely unexpected, it was held that the accused was
not guilty of murder but of causing grievous hurt under section 325.731. Where the
medical evidence showed that the injury on the forehead which caused death was by a
lathi and not by an iron rod as deposed to by witnesses and the internal injury could not
be correlated to the external injury caused by the accused, it was held to be a fit case
where the accused should be convicted only under section 325 IPC, 1860.732. Where
the accused acting on a sudden spur of the moment squeezed the testicles of the
deceased as a result of which he had a shock resulting in cardiac arrest and sudden
death, the Supreme Court came to the conclusion that it was a case falling under the
eighth clause of the section, i.e., causing hurt which endangers life. It was a case of
grievous hurt punishable under section 325 and not that of simple hurt punishable
under section 323.733. See also discussion and cases under sub-head "Act neither
intended nor likely to cause death is hurt even though death is caused" under section
319, ante.
[s 320.6] Spleen.—
Where the accused, pulling the deceased out of a cot, kicked him, and struck him on
the side or on the ribs with a stick, whereby the deceased, whose spleen was diseased,
died, it was held that he was guilty of voluntarily causing grievous hurt.734.
[s 320.7] Blow aimed at a person falling upon another.—
The accused struck a woman, carrying an infant in her arms, violently over her head
and shoulders. One of the blows fell on the child's head causing death. It was held that
the accused had committed hurt on the infant under circumstances of sufficient
aggravation to bring the offence within the definition of grievous hurt.735. In the course
of an altercation between the accused and the complainant on a dark night, the former
aimed a blow with his stick at the head of the latter. To ward off the blow, the
complainant's wife, who had a child on her arm, intervened between them. The blow
missed its aim, but fell on the head of the child causing severe injuries, from the effects
of which it died. It was held that the accused was guilty of simple hurt only.736. The
accused had the intention of causing hurt to a person but not grievous hurt and the
nature of the blow, taken with reference to the person against whom it was aimed,
cannot be taken to indicate the necessary intention or knowledge as to causing
grievous hurt.
[s 320.8] Use of weapon.—
To cause "grievous hurt" it is not necessary that any weapon of offence must be used.
Even without any weapon, an injury of the nature mentioned in section 320 could be
caused. The offence under section 325 is voluntarily causing grievous hurt. It does not
speak of use of any weapon of offence.737.
[s 320.9] Supply of arrack mixed with dangerous substance.—
The arrack supplied was mixed with methyl alcohol resulting in many deaths. The Court
concluded that the person responsible for the mixing had knowledge that the
consumption of such substance was likely to cause serious adverse effects. Some of
the victims lost eyesight. The Court said that the maximum sentence under the section
was properly awarded.738.
