property.
Whoever wrongfully confines any person for the purpose of extorting from the person
confined or any person interested in the person confined any confession or any
information which may lead to the detection of an offence or misconduct, or for the
purpose of constraining the person confined or any person interested in the person
confined to restore or to cause the restoration of any property or valuable security or
to satisfy any claim or demand, or to give information which may lead to the
restoration of any property or valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment
of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be
liable to fine.
COMMENT.â€”
This section may be compared with section 330. In the former case confession is
extorted by wrongful confinement; in the latter, by causing hurt. To prove an offence
under this section it is not necessary to show that a formal arrest was made. It is
enough if it is shown that the person was prevented from proceeding beyond certain
circumscribed limits.959. Evidence showed that deceased died of multiple injuries and
such injuries were caused when deceased was in illegal custody of accused. Accused
was held liable to be convicted under sections 348 and 304 Part II of IPC, 1860.960.
