Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself
bound, by law.
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake
of fact 1 and not by reason of a mistake of law 2 in good faith believes himself to be,
bound by law 3 to do it.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of his superior officer, in conformity with
the commands of the law. A has committed no offence.
(b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and,
after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, arrests Z. A has committed no offence.
COMMENT.—
Sections 76 and 79 are based on the maxim ignorantia facti doth excusat and ignorantia
juris non excusat. Section 76 excuses a person who has done what by law is an offence,
under a misconception of facts, leading him to believe in good faith that he was
commanded by law to do it. See Comment on section 79, infra.
This section and sections 77, 78 and 79 deal with acts of a person bound or justified by
law. This section as well as sections 78 and 79 deal with acts of a person under a
mistake.
1. 'Mistake of fact'.—See Comment under section 79, infra.
2. 'Mistake of law'.—See Comment under section 79, infra.
3. 'In good faith believes himself to be, bound by law'.—In order to entitle a person to
claim the benefit of this section it is necessary to show the existence of a state of facts
which would justify the belief in good faith, interpreting the latter expression with
reference to section 52, that the person to whom the order was given was bound by law
to obey it. Thus, in the case of a soldier, the Penal Code does not recognize the mere
duty of blind obedience to the commands of a superior as sufficient to protect him
from the penal consequences of his act. But in certain circumstances a soldier
receives absolute protection under section 132 of the Cr PC, 1973.
For illegal acts, however, neither the orders of a parent nor a master nor a superior will
furnish any defence. Nothing but fear of instant death is a defence for a policeman who
tortures anyone by order of a superior. The maxim respondeat superior has no
application to such a case.6. The net position appears to be that if superior order is in
conformity with the law no further question arises and the subordinate officer is
protected by section 76 IPC, 1860, if he carries out that order. It is only when the order
is not in accordance with the law but the subordinate officer who carries out that order
in good faith, on account of a mistake of fact and not on ground of mistake of law,
believes himself to be bound by law to carry out such an order, that a further question
arises as to whether the subordinate officer will not still get protection of section 76
IPC, 1860, because of his mistake of fact. Thus, where the order was legal in the
circumstances of the case, e.g., where the police patrol party opened fire under the
order of the Deputy Commissioner of Police after it had been attacked on a dark night
and an Assistant Commissioner of Police had been injured as a result of such attack,
really no question arose for the application of section 76 IPC, 1860, as the order was
both legal and justified by the circumstances of the case.7. The Indian law as contained
in sections 76 and 79 of the Penal Code appears to be the same as in England. This
point has, however, not been clearly decided in any case including the decision of the
Supreme Court in Shew Mangal Singh's case.8. There are, however, enough indications
in Shew Mangal Singh's case and in sections 76 and 79 IPC, 1860, that if the
subordinate due to a mistake of fact and not due to a mistake of law honestly believed
that he was bound or justified by law in carrying out the superior order which though
not manifestly illegal was nevertheless illegal, perhaps he would still get the benefit of
superior order. Obedience to an illegal order can only be used in mitigation of
punishment but cannot be used as a complete defence.9. If on account of any
abnormal reaction, the employee has committed suicide, the conduct of the
complainant or of higher officer of taking departmental action by way of resorting to
legal remedy or enforcement of law, cannot be termed as leaving no option to the
delinquent employee but to commit suicide and, therefore, cannot be said as abetment
or incitement to suicide under such circumstances. In any case any action for resorting
to legal remedy for grievances or for enforcement of law in exercise of powers or
purported exercise of power cannot be said to contain any element of criminality
unless such action is ex facie without any competence, authority or jurisdiction.10.
