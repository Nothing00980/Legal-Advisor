State Amendment
Uttar Pradesh.—The offence u/s. 363 IPC is non-bailable, vide U.P. Act, No. 1 of 1984.
COMMENT.—
This section must be read with section 361. The offence of kidnapping from lawful
guardianship penalised by this section is the offence which is defined by section 361.
The person against whom the offence is committed must be under the age of sixteen,
if a male, and under the age of eighteen, if a female.1082.
[s 363.1] Tribal Custom.—
Where a married girl of 17 years of age was forcibly carried away by the accused and
his companions from a jungle where she had gone with others to collet mohua flowers
with a view to marrying her according to their tribal custom, it was held that such a
custom, if any, could apply only to the cases of young unmarried men and women and
had no application to legalise the kidnapping of a married minor girl out of the keeping
of her lawful guardian.1083.
[s 363.2] Section 363 IPC is not a minor offence of Section 376 IPC, 1860.—
Offence of kidnapping under section 363 IPC, 1860 and of rape under section 376 IPC,
1860 cannot be held to be cognate offences. Therefore, accused cannot be convicted
for offence of kidnapping in absence of charge framed against him for the said
offence.1084.
[s 363.3] Extradition offence.—
Offence under section 363 of the IPC, 1860 is an extraditable offence, provided it is not
a pure matrimonial dispute.1085.

1082. Ismail Sayadsaheb, (1933) 35 Bom LR 886 : 57 Bom 537 FB. Anandham v State of TN,
(1995) 1 Cr LJ 632 (Mad), here the accused was acquitted under section 376 (rape) and section
366 (kidnapping for marriage), he was convicted under this section for simple kidnapping. Omi v
State of UP, 1994 Cr LJ 155 (All), acquittal from charges of kidnapping and rape, story of the
victim not reliable, medical evidence also not proving rape. Kuldeep K Mahato v State of Bihar,
AIR 1998 SC 2694 [LNIND 1998 SC 714] : 1998 Cr LJ 1597 (Raj), the prosecutrix was below 18
years of age. She was taken away by the accused person to a particular place by means of a
tempo. The court said that the offence of kidnapping from lawful guardianship was made out.
But ingredients of the offence of rape not proved. Hence, no conviction for rape. Bagula Naik v
State of Orissa, 1999 Cr LJ 2077 (Ori), a girl left home of her own, met by chance a person on the
road who took her to his home and detained her for several days. The version given by the girl
was truthful. The fact that there was no mens rea and he appeared before the police along with
the girl was not sufficient to prove his innocence. His conviction was maintained. Sumitra Bai v
State of MP, 1999 Cr LJ 2541 (MP), taken away by one person and deposited in the house of
another, both liable. Mahesh Kumar v State of Rajasthan, 1998 Cr LJ 597 (Raj), gang rape after

of the other. Akeel v State of MP, 1998 Cr LJ 4530 (MP) consenting party to sex, accused not

kidnapping not proper.
