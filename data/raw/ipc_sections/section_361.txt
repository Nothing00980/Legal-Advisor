Assault or criminal force on grave provocation.
Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person on grave and sudden
provocation given by that person, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a
term which may extend to one month, or with fine which may extend to two hundred
rupees, or with both.
Explanation.—The last section is subject to the same Explanation as section 352.
COMMENT.—
This section provides for mild punishment if the assault or criminal force is the result
of grave and sudden provocation.
The word "last" in the Explanation is inaccurate. Instead of the words "the last" the word
"this" only should have been used.
