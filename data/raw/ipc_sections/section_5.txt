Certain laws not to be affected by this Act.
Nothing in this Act shall affect the provisions of any Act for punishing mutiny and
desertion of officers, soldiers, sailors or airmen in the service of the Government of
India or the provisions of any special or local law 1 .]
COMMENT—
This section is a saving clause to section 2. Though the Code was intended to be a
general one, it was not thought desirable to make it exhaustive, and hence, offences
defined by local and special laws were left out of the Code, and merely declared to be
punishable as theretofore.78. Thus, the personnel of the Army, Navy and Airforce are
governed by the provisions of the Army Act, 1950, The Navy Act, 1957, and The Indian
Air Force Act, 1950 in regard to offences of mutiny and desertion committed by
them.79.
1. 'Special or local law'.—A special law is a law relating to a particular subject;80.
whereas a local law is a law which applies only to a particular part of the country.81.
The distinction between a statute creating a new offence with a particular penalty and
a statute enlarging the ambit of an existing offence by including new acts within it with
a particular penalty is well settled. In the former case the new offence is punishable by
the new penalty only; in the latter it is punishable also by all such penalties as were
applicable before the Act to the offence in which it is included. The Principle is that
where a new offence is created and the particular manner in which proceedings should
be taken is laid down, then proceedings cannot be taken in any other way.82. However,
a person cannot be punished under both the Penal Code and a special law for the same
offence,83. and ordinarily the sentence should be under the special Act.84. This is,
however, confined to cases where the offences are coincident or practically so.85.
The Supreme Court issued specific guidelines regarding the interpretation of general law
and special law. See the Box below for these Guidelines.
Supreme Court Guidelines on Interpretation of General law and Special law
(i) When a provision of law regulates a particular subject and a subsequent law
contains a provision regulating the same subject, there is no presumption that
the later law repeals the earlier law. The rule-making authority while making the
later rule is deemed to know the existing law on the subject. If the subsequent
law does not repeal the earlier rule, there can be no presumption of an intention
to repeal the earlier rule;
(ii) When two provisions of law — one being a general law and the other being
special law govern a matter, the court should endeavour to apply a harmonious
construction to the said provisions. But where the intention of the rule-making
authority is made clear either expressly or impliedly, as to which law should
prevail, the same shall be given effect.
(iii) If the repugnancy or inconsistency subsists in spite of an effort to read them
harmoniously, the prior special law is not presumed to be repealed by the later
general law. The prior special law will continue to apply and prevail in spite of
the subsequent general law. But where a clear intention to make a rule of
universal application by superseding the earlier special law is evident from the
later general law, then the later general law, will prevail over the prior special law.
(iv) Where a later special law is repugnant to or inconsistent with an earlier general
law, the later special law will prevail over the earlier general law.

[s 5.1] Contempt of Court
Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (Act 70 of 1971) makes it clear that, Contempt of Court
means 'Civil contempt' or 'Criminal contempt'.88. 'Civil contempt' means wilful
disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a Court
or wilful breach of an Undertaking given to a Court.89. "Criminal contempt" means the
publication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible
representations, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever
which – (i) scandalises or tends to scandalise or lowers or tends to lower the authority
of any Court; or (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of
any judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends
to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner.90. The provisions of this
Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of, the provisions of any other law
relating to contempt of Courts.91. Contempt proceeding is sui generis (of its own kind
or class or unique). It has peculiar features which are not found in criminal
proceedings. The respondent does not stand in the position of a person accused of an
offence. Initiation of contempt proceedings against the respondent who is already
accused in a criminal proceedings, does not amount to double jeopardy.92. Mens rea is
not necessary for committing contempt of Court. The main ingredient of the offence of
contempt of Court is the result of one's contumacious act of offending the prestige and
dignity of the judiciary so as to lower it in the estimation of the general public. Whether
the contemnor intended it or not is of no consequence.93.
[s 5.2] Contempt of Supreme Court and High Courts
Articles 129 and 215 preserve all the powers of the Supreme Court and the High Court,
respectively, as a Court of Record which includes the power to punish the contempt of
itself. There are no curbs on the power of the High Court to punish for contempt of
itself except those contained in the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.94. For the judiciary
to carry out its obligations effectively and true to the spirit with which it is sacredly
entrusted the task, constitutional Courts have been given the power to punish for
contempt, but greater the power; higher the responsibility.95.
[s 5.3] Contempt of Subordinate Courts
Every High Court shall have and exercise the same jurisdiction, powers and authority, in
accordance with the same procedure and practice, in respect of contempt of Courts
subordinate to it as it has and exercises in respect of contempt of itself provided that
no High Court shall take cognizance of a contempt alleged to have been committed in
respect of a Court subordinate to it where such contempt is an offence punishable
under the IPC, 1860 [section 10 Contempt of Courts Act, 1971]. The procedure
prescribed either under the Cr PC, 1973 or under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is not
attracted to the proceedings initiated under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act.
The High Court can deal with such matters summarily and adopt its own procedure.
The only caution that has to be observed by the Court in exercising this inherent power
of summary procedure is that the procedure followed must be fair and the contemnors
are made aware of the charges levelled against them and given a fair and reasonable
opportunity.96.
[s 5.4] Section 228 IPC vis-a-vis Contempt of Courts Act
What is made publishable under section 228 IPC, 186097. is the offence of intentional
insult to a Judge or interruption of Court proceedings but not as a contempt of Court.
The definition of criminal contempt is wide enough to include any act by a person
which would either scandalise the Court or tend to interfere with the administration of
justice. It would also include any act which lowers the authority of the Court or
prejudices or interferes with the due course of any judicial proceedings. It is not limited
to the offering of intentional insult to the Judge or interruption of the judicial
proceedings.98.
