Causing death of quick unborn child by act amounting to culpable
homicide.
Whoever does any act under such circumstances, that if he thereby caused death he
would be guilty of culpable homicide, and does by such act cause the death of a quick
unborn child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
ILLUSTRATION
A, knowing that he is likely to cause the death of a pregnant woman does an act which,
if it caused the death of the woman would amount to culpable homicide. The woman is
injured, but does not die; but the death of an unborn quick child with which she is
pregnant is thereby caused. A is guilty of the offence defined in this section.
COMMENT.—
This section punishes offences against children in the womb where the pregnancy has
advanced beyond the stage of quickening and where the death is caused after the
quickening and before the birth of the child. Any act or omission of such a nature and
done under such circumstances as would amount to the offence of culpable homicide,
if the sufferer were a living person, will, if done to a quick unborn child whose death is
caused by it, constitute the offence here punished.
Unless the act is done against the mother with an intention or with a knowledge which
brings it within the purview of section 299, it cannot constitute an offence under this
section merely because the death of a quick unborn child has resulted from an act
against the mother.707. A husband striking his wife dead was held guilty of the offence
under this section. The medical evidence showed that she was carrying a male child of
20 weeks. A foetus gets life after 12 weeks of conception.708.
The principle laid down in section 301 is again applied here.
[s 316.1] Charge.—
The trial Court did not frame charge against accused no. 3 for the offence under
section 312 of the IPC, 1860 but that will not come in the way in convicting him for the
offence under section 312, IPC, 1860. Because the offences from sections 312 to 318
are of similar nature, type and category, they are all relating to miscarriage. Secondly,
the punishment prescribed under section 312 is not higher than the maximum
punishment prescribed under section 316. Because the punishment prescribed is up to
10 years if the act causes death of quick unborn child. The maximum punishment
prescribed under section 312 is seven years if the woman be quick with child.709.
