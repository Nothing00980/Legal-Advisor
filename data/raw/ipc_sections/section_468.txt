COMMENT—
The offence under this section is an aggravated form of the offence described in the
preceding section. When a person is charged under section 457 IPC, 1860, on the
allegation that he entered the dwelling house of another person with the intention of
committing theft it will not be legal to convict him under section 456 on the ground that
the entry was made with the intention of committing some other offence or with the
intention of annoying or insulting the inmates.721.
[s 457.1] For committing offence under the section.—
To constitute an offence under section 457, it is necessary to prove that house
trespass or breaking at night was committed in order to commit any offence
punishable under this section. The mere fact that house trespass was committed at
night does not attract the offence of lurking house trespass within the meaning of this
section.722.

722. Kandarpa Thakuria v State of Assam, 1992 Cr LJ 3084 (Gau). State of Rajasthan v Vinod,
2002 Cr LJ 1308 (Raj), the accused and his family were proved to be persons known to the
complainant being neighbours. The entry into the house could not be proved to be with the
intention of committing an offence punishable with imprisonment. The finding of acquittal was
not interfered with. Satyanarayanan v State of Rajasthan, 2000 Cr LJ 2529 (Raj) accused entered
house at night, beat up the girl and subjected her to rape, conviction under section 458 was
altered to one under section 457 as the accused had not committed lurking house trespass. He
had made preparation for assault. Harjit Singh v State of Haryana, 1999 Cr LJ 580 (SC) offence
under sections 457, 392, 397, 307, 332, 34, made out. See also R Trinath v State of Orissa, 1998
Cr LJ 3458 (Ori). Joseph v State of Kerala, 1997 Cr LJ 4289 (Ker), case of theft not made out.
Raghabacharan Panda v V Dindayal Patra, 2003 Cr LJ 1307 (Ori), allegation that the shop of the
chemist broken open by the landlord and handed over to another person for another purpose,
evidence was in favour of the accused land lord and his new tenant. Benefit of doubt. Md.
Siddique Hussain v State of Assam, 2003 Cr LJ 1487 (Gau), it was difficult for the court to believe
that any one should force his way to the house of another just only to committing a hurt. Benefit
of doubt.
