Abettor.
A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the
commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by
law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the
abettor.
Explanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an
offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.
Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act
abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence
should be caused.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to
commit murder.
(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers
from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.
Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law
of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or
knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would
be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an
offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be
committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.
(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of
age, to do an act which causes Z's death. B, in consequence of the abetment,
does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here though B
was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in
the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and
had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.
(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the
unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or
that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in
consequence of A's instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of
abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the
punishment provided for that offence.
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property
belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A induces B to believe that the property
belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing
it to be A's property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take
dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting
theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.
Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such
an abetment is also an offence.
ILLUSTRATION
A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C
commits that offence in consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for
his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the
offence, A is also liable to the same punishment.
Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by
conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits
it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is
committed.
ILLUSTRATION
A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison.
B then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison,
but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and
delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers
the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together,
yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered.
C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the
punishment for murder.
COMMENTS.—
Abetment under the IPC, 1860 involves active complicity on the part of the abettor at a
point of time prior to the actual commission of the offence,59. and it is of the essence
of the crime of abetment that the abettor should substantially assist the principal
culprit towards the commission of the offence. Nowhere, concurrence in the criminal
acts of another without such participation therein as helps to give effect to the criminal
act or purpose, is punishable under the Code.
'Abettor', under this section, means the person who abets (1) the commission of an
offence, or (2) the commission of an act, which would be an offence if committed by a
person not suffering from any physical or mental incapacity. In the light of the
preceding section he must be an instigator or a conspirator or an intentional helper.
Merely because the accused's brother was carrying on criminal activities in her house,
the appellant cannot be held guilty unless there is some material to show her
complicity.60.
Explanation 1.—If a public servant is guilty of an illegal omission of duty made
punishable by the Code, and a private person instigates him, then he abets the offence
of which such public servant is guilty, though the abettor, being a private person, could
not himself have been guilty of that offence.
Explanation 2.—The question regarding abettor's guilt depends on the nature of the act
abetted and the manner in which abetment was made. Commission of the act abetted
is not necessary for the offence of abetment.61. The offence of abetment is complete
notwithstanding that the person abetted refuses to do the thing, or fails involuntarily in
doing it, or does it and the expected result does not follow. The offence of abetment by
instigation depends upon the intention of the person who abets, and not upon the act
which is actually done by the person whom he abets.
Explanation 3.—This explanation makes it clear that the person abetted need not have
any guilty intention in committing the act abetted. It applies to abetment generally and
there is nothing to indicate that it applies only to abetment by instigation and not to
other kinds of abetment.62. The offence of abetment depends upon the intention of the
person who abets and not upon the knowledge or intention of the person he employs to
act for him.
Explanation 4.—This Explanation is to be read as follows: "When the abetment of an
offence is an offence the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence". In view of
Explanation 4 appended under section 108 of the IPC, 1860 the contention of accused
that there cannot be any abetment of an abetment and it is unknown to criminal
jurisprudence, holds no water and merits no consideration.63.
[s 108.1] Abetment of attempt to commit suicide.—
Section 306 prescribes punishment for abetment of suicide while section 309 punishes
attempt to commit suicide. Abetment of attempt to commit suicide is outside the
purview of section 306 and it is punishable only under section 309 and read with
section 107, IPC, 1860.64.
[s 108.2] Euthanasia.—
Assisted suicide and assisted attempt to commit suicide are made punishable for
cogent reasons in the interest of society. Such a provision is considered desirable to
also prevent the danger inherent in the absence of such a penal provision.65. But in
Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v UOI,66. the Supreme Court held that passive euthanasia
can be allowed under exceptional circumstances under the strict monitoring of the
Court. In March 2018, a five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court gave legal
sanction to passive euthanasia, permitting 'living will' by patients.67.
[s 108.3] Political murder.—
The accused were poor villagers who were brainwashed and became tools for
committing crimes. The leaders who called for revenge were not charge sheeted and
they got off scot-free. Even their names were not revealed as they were political head-
weight. Such leaders who prompt the followers to commit crimes should be charge
sheeted for abetment of offence for murder.
[s 108.4] Abetment is substantive offence.—
The offence of abetment is a substantive one and the conviction of an abettor is,
therefore, in no way dependent on the conviction of the principal.68. It cannot be held in
law that a person cannot ever be convicted of abetting a certain offence when the
person alleged to have committed that offence in consequence of the abetment has
been acquitted. The question of the abettor's guilt depends on the nature of the act
abetted and the manner in which the abetment was made. Under section 107, IPC,
1860 a person abets the doing of an act in either of three ways which can be:
instigating any person to do an act; or engaging with one or more person in any
conspiracy for the doing of that act; or intentionally aiding the doing of that act. If a
person instigates another or engages with another in a conspiracy for the doing of an
act which is an offence, he abets such an offence and would be guilty of abetment
under section 115 or section 116, IPC, 1860 even if the offence abetted is not
committed in consequence of the abetment. The offence of abetment is complete
when the alleged abettor has instigated another or engaged with another in a
conspiracy to commit the offence. It is not necessary for the offence of abetment that
the act abetted must be committed. This is clear from Explanation 2 and illustration (a)
thereto, to section 108, IPC, 1860. It is only in the case of a person abetting an offence
by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the charge of abetment
against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to have committed the
offence is acquitted of that offence.69.
