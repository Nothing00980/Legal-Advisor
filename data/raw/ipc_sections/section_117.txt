Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in
consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment.
Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of
the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of
such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment,
when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the
conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in
the exercise of B's official functions. B accepts the bribe. A has abetted the
offence defined in section 161.
(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation,
commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the
same punishment as B.
(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the
poison and delivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance
of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A's absence and thereby causes
Z's death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by
conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder.
COMMENTS.—
Under this section the abettor is liable to the same punishment as that which may be
inflicted on the principal offender, (1) if the act of the latter is committed in
consequence of the abetment, and (2) no express provision is made in the Code for the
punishment of such an abetment. Section 109, IPC, 1860 becomes applicable even if
the abettor is not present when the offence abetted is committed provided that he has
instigated the commission of the offence or has engaged with one or more other
persons in a conspiracy to commit an offence and pursuant to that conspiracy some
act or illegal omission takes place or has intentionally aided the commission of an
offence by an act or illegal omission.76.
[s 109.1] Scope.—
This section lays down nothing more than that if the IPC, 1860 has not separately
provided for the punishment of abetment as such then it is punishable with the
punishment provided for the original offence. Law does not require instigation to be in
a particular form or that it should only be in words. The instigation may be by conduct.
Whether there was instigation or not, is a question to be decided on the facts of each
case. It is not necessary in law for the prosecution to prove that the actual operative
cause in the mind of the person abetting was instigation and nothing else, so long as
there was instigation and the offence has been committed or the offence would have
been committed if the person committing the act had the same knowledge and
intention as the abettor. The instigation must be with reference to the thing that was
done and not to the thing that was likely to have been done by the person who is
instigated. It is only if this condition is fulfilled that a person can be guilty of abetment
by instigation. Further, the act abetted should be committed in consequence of the
abetment or in pursuance of the conspiracy as provided in the Explanation to section
109. Under the Explanation an act or offence is said to be committed in pursuance of
abetment if it is done in consequence of (a) instigation (b) conspiracy or (c) with the
aid constituting abetment. Instigation may be in any form and the extent of the
influence which the instigation produced in the mind of the accused would vary and
depend upon facts of each case. The offence of conspiracy created under section
120A is bare agreement to commit an offence. It has been made punishable under
section 120B. The offence of abetment created under the second clause of section 107
requires that there must be something more than mere conspiracy. There must be
some act or illegal omission in pursuance of that conspiracy. That would be evident by
section 107 (second), "engages in any conspiracy … for the doing of that thing, if an act
or omission took place in pursuance of that conspiracy". The punishment for these two
categories of crimes is also quite different. Section 109, IPC, 1860 is concerned only
with the punishment of abetment for which no express provision has been made in the
IPC, 1860. The charge under section 109 should, therefore, be along with charge for
murder which is the offence committed in consequence of abetment. An offence of
criminal conspiracy is, on the other hand, an independent offence. It is made
punishable under section 120B for which a charge under section 109 is unnecessary
and inappropriate.77. Section 109 provides that if the act abetted is committed in
consequence of abetment and there is no provision for the punishment of such
abetment then the offender is to be punished with the punishment provided for the
original offence. "Act abetted" in section 109 means the specific offence abetted.
Therefore, the offence for the abetment of which a person is charged with the
abetment is normally linked with the proved offence.78. The commission of the offence
of rape in a hut then in possession of the accused was held to be not sufficient in itself
to show that the accused abetted the offence.79.
[s 109.2] Distinct offence.—
Section 109 is by itself creative of an offence though it is punishable in the context of
other offences. The accused was charged under sections 300 and 149. The Court said
that he could not be convicted under section 300 with the aid of section 109. That
would cause great prejudice to the accused in his defence.80. The offence for the
abetment of which a person is charged with the abetment is normally linked with the
proved offence.81. A plain reading of sections 107–109 of the IPC, 1860 would show
that act complained of in order to amount to abetment has to be committed either prior
to or at the time of commission of the offences.82.
Where the appellant, the wife of a co-accused asked the prosecutrix, aged 15 years to
go to the house of the accused and to bring lassi, and when the prosecutrix reached
there, the co-accused, who were two in number, bolted the house from inside and
committed rape on her, it was held that the appellant was guilty of the offence of
abetment. 83.
[s 109.3] Failure to prevent is not abetment.—
It has been held by the Supreme Court that a failure to prevent the commission of an
offence is not an abetment of that offence. The Court said:
Where a person aids and abets the perpetrator of a crime at the very time when the crime is
committed, he is a principal of the second degree and section 109 applies. But mere failure
to prevent the commission of an offence is not by itself an abetment of that offence.
Considering the definition in section 109 strictly, the instigation must have reference to the
thing that was done and not to the thing that was likely to have been done by the person
who is instigated. It is only if this condition is fulfilled that a person can be guilty of
abetment by instigation. Section 109 is attracted even if the abettor is not present when the
offence abetted is committed provided that he had instigated the commission of the
offence or had engaged with one or more other persons in a conspiracy to commit an
offence and pursuant to the conspiracy some act or illegal omission takes place or
intentionally induced the commission of an offence by an act or illegal omission. In the
absence of direct involvement, conviction for abetment is not sustainable. Section 109
provides that if the act abetted is committed in consequence of abetment and there is no
provision for the punishment of such abetment then the offender is to be punished with the
punishment provided for the original offence. Section 109 applies even where the abettor is
not present. Active abetment at the time of committing the offence is covered by section
109.
The words 'act abetted' as used in section 109 means the specific offence abetted. Mere
help in the preparation for the commission of an offence which is not ultimately committed
is not abetment within the meaning of section 109. 'Any offence' in section 109 means
offence punishable under IPC or any special or local law. The abetment of an offence under
the special or local law, therefore, is punishable under section 109. For constituting offence
of abetment, intentional and active participation by the abettor is necessary.84.
When a person is charged with the abetment of an offence, it is normally linked with an
offence which has been proved.85.
[s 109.4] Procedure.—Failure to frame Charge.—
Section 109, IPC, 1860 is a distinct offence. Accused having faced trial for being a
member of an unlawful assembly which achieved the common object of killing the
deceased, could in no event be substitutedly convicted for offence under section 302,
IPC, 1860 with the aid of section 109, IPC, 1860. There was obviously thus, not only a
legal flaw but also a great prejudice to the appellant in projecting his defence.86.
Section 109, IPC, 1860 is by itself an offence though punishable in the context of other
offences.87.
[s 109.5] Sentence.—
When the act abetted is committed as a consequence of abetment, the abettor should
be punished with the punishment provided for the main offence with the help of section
109, IPC, 1860 and even if a charge under section 120B, IPC, 1860 had been framed, no
separate sentence under that section is called for.88. No distinction should be made in
the quantum of sentence to be awarded to the principal offender and that awarded to
the abettor.89.
[s 109.6] Compoundable.—
When an offence is compoundable under section 320 of the Cr PC, 1973, the abetment
of such may be compounded in like manner.90.
[s 109.7] CASES.—
Where the accused instigated others to assault with deadly weapons and not to kill, he
should be convicted under section 324 read with section 109, IPC, 1860 and not under
section 307 read with section 109, IPC, 1860.91. Where the accused did not participate
in the act of rape but kept watch while others were committing the offence, and thereby
aided and abetted the commission of the crime instead of preventing it, he was held
liable to be convicted under section 376 read with this section and not under section
376 read with section 34.92.
[s 109.8] Distinction between sections 109 and 114.—
There is a distinction between section 109 and section 114. Section 114 applies where
a criminal first abets an offence to be committed by another person, and is
subsequently present at its commission. Active abetment at the time of committing the
offence is covered by section 109 and section 114 is clearly intended for an abetment
previous to the actual commission of the crime, that is, before the first steps have been
taken to commit it.93.
