Attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with deadly weapon.
If, at the time of attempting to commit robbery or dacoity, the offender is armed with
any deadly weapon, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished
shall not be less than seven years.
COMMENT—
This section can regulate the punishment only in cases of an attempt to commit
robbery as distinguished from a case in which the offender has accomplished his
purpose and robbery has actually been committed.231. It applies to such of the
offenders as are armed with deadly weapons though they do not use them in the
attempt to rob or commit dacoity. It does not apply to other offenders who in
combination with such persons have committed robbery or dacoity.232. The words
"uses" and "is armed" in sections 397 and 398, IPC, 1860, have to be given identical
meaning to resolve apparent anomaly.233. Thus, carrying a deadly weapon would be
enough to attract the mischief of either section. In the charge-sheet, accused were
charged under section 396. Section 398 is referred only for the purpose of sentence.
Hence, the argument that when section 398 is attracted, life imprisonment cannot be
awarded is untenable. Substantive offence here is section 396. But, if section 398 is
attracted, minimum punishment shall be seven years. Sections 397 and 398 cannot be
used conjunctively or constructively as held by the Apex Court in Paramjeet Singh v
State of Rajasthan.234. In fact, as held in various Court decisions, a person cannot be
convicted under section 398 unless he is armed with a deadly weapon while
committing or attempting to commit robbery or dacoity.235.
Section 398, IPC, 1860 gets attracted if at the time of attempting to commit robbery or
dacoity, the offender is armed with a deadly weapon which will attract an imprisonment
not less than seven years. When no robbery or dacoity has been committed as such, in
the sense that no property was removed from the house of the complainants and
nothing said to be belonging to the complainants was recovered, it would be difficult to
hold that there was any attempt in regard to the commission of robbery or dacoity.
Scattering of articles in the house may cause a scene as if ransacked, but that does not
proved the charge.236. For the offence of attempt to commit robbery the maximum
punishment prescribed by law is rigorous imprisonment for seven years with fine.
However the discretion is left to the Court to quantify the actual sentence to be
awarded. However, if at the time of attempting to commit robbery the offender is
armed with any deadly weapon, the offence becomes more serious or aggravated and
therefore, section 398 provides that in such circumstances the imprisonment with
which, the offender shall be punishable, shall not be less than seven years. If at the
time of committing robbery the offender is not armed with any deadly weapon the
Court may award sentence of imprisonment for a term up to seven years and if he was
armed with deadly weapon the sentence of imprisonment shall not be less than seven
years. In such circumstances the maximum sentence of rigorous imprisonment of
seven years has to be awarded. It is well settled that section 398 IPC, 1860 does not
create any offence but merely regulates the punishment already provided for robbery or
dacoity. One cannot be convicted and sentenced separately under sections 393 and
398 of IPC, 1860.237.
[s 398.1] Cases.—
The allegation was that appellants entered into the house of complainant, injured her in
order to commit robbery but was apprehended by police. They demanded key of
almirah and ornaments from complainant by overawing her with deadly weapons like
knife and kattas. High Court held that conviction under section 394 read with section
397 deserves to be converted into one under section 394 read with s, 398 of IPC,
1860.238.
[s 398.2] Charge under section 398 conviction under section 458 IPC, 1860.—
The accused was charged under section 398 of IPC, 1860 and section 25(1)(A) and
section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959. Trial Court acquitted the accused from both the
charges holding that prosecution has failed to prove the charges, however, come to the
conclusion that the accused committed an offence under section 458 of IPC, 1860. The
High Court held that section 458 of Penal Code in no way was a cognate offence of
offence prescribed under section 398, IPC, 1860. Hence, Conviction for offence under
section 458 IPC, 1860 without framing charge was set aside.239.
