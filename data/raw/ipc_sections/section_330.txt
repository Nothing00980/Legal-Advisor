Voluntarily causing hurt to extort property, or to constrain to an illegal
act.
Whoever voluntarily causes hurt, for the purpose of extorting from the sufferer, or
from any person interested in the sufferer, any property or valuable security, or of
constraining the sufferer or any person interested in such sufferer to do anything
which is illegal or which may facilitate the commission of an offence, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten
years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.â€”
This is an aggravated form of the offence of hurt and is severely punishable, because
the object of causing it is to extort property from the sufferer. Where one of the five
persons accused of murder was armed with a sharp-edged weapon but inflicted only
one injury by the blunt side of his weapon, he could only be said to have shared the
common intention of causing simple injury and was liable under section 327 and not
under section 300.849.
