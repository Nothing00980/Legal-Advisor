Limit of solitary confinement.
In executing a sentence of solitary confinement, such confinement shall in no case
exceed fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the periods of solitary
confinement of not less duration than such periods; and when the imprisonment
awarded shall exceed three months, the solitary confinement shall not exceed seven
days in any one month of the whole imprisonment awarded, with intervals between
the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration than such periods.
COMMENTâ€”
Solitary confinement if continued for a long time is sure to produce mental
derangement.
The section limits the solitary confinement, when the substantive sentence exceeds
three months, to seven days in any one month. Solitary confinement must be imposed
at intervals. A sentence inflicting solitary confinement for the whole imprisonment is
illegal, though not more than 14 days is awarded.251.
