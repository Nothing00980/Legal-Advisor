Intentional omission to give information of offence by person bound to
inform.
Whoever, knowing or having reason to believe that an offence has been committed,
intentionally omits to give any information respecting that offence which he is legally
bound to give, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This section punishes the illegal omission to give information of those who are by
some law bound to give information, when such omission is intentional. It is similar to
section 176. See sections 39 and 40, Criminal Procedure Code, as to the persons
legally bound to give information. The word "whoever" in section 202, IPC, 1860, refers
to persons other than the offender.185. Moreover to compel a criminal to incriminate
himself would violate the spirit of Article 20(3) of the Constitution. Where the duty to
inform arises first and is not performed, the liability under this section would arise and
it would be no defence that subsequent to the breach of duty there was involvement of
the accused person in some crimes. The person who knew or had reason to believe
that death was not natural was obliged under the section to give information.186.
[s 202.1] Essential Ingredients.—
To sustain a conviction under the above quoted section 202 of the Penal Code, it is
necessary for the prosecution to prove:
(1) that the accused had knowledge or reason to believe that some offence had been
committed,
(2) that the accused had intentionally omitted to give information respecting that
offence and
(3) that the accused was legally bound to give that information.187.

[s 202.2] CASES.—
The accused persons who raped a girl of 11 years and caused her death by thrusting a
stick into her private part were under no obligation to file information of their own
criminality, they became liable under this section because by falsely telling the mother
of the victim that they had already reported the matter, they prevented her from lodging
report with the police.188.
This section has also no application where the principal offence has not been
established.189.
[s 202.3] Failure of doctor to give information.—
The allegation was the Accused, a dentist treated one of the injured assailants by
suturing (stitching) his wound on the back after applying local anaesthesia pursuance
of a previous plan that if and when any of the assailants got injured in the attack then
immediate medical treatment would be given by the accused to the injured. The
accused stitched the back of an assailant, which is not the job of a dentist. Offence
under section 201 prima facie made out.190. The failure on the part of the doctor to give
information to the police (in this case information was given after a gap of six days)
has been held not to constitute any offence under section 202. It would have to be
shown that doctors were duty bound to give such information that there was
knowledge that in the burning of the lady some offence was involved. Even where this
would be so, it would be a separate offence. The doctors cannot be prosecuted jointly
with the main accused.191.
