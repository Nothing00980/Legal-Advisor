COMMENTâ€”
Where evidence on record clearly establishes that the sugarcane stems in the fields of
the claimants were totally destroyed by using a tractor. Therefore, section 427, IPC,
1860 is clearly established.633.
While causing mischief, there must be an intention behind that. In the present case, the
petitioners were discharging their official duty. Therefore, they had no intention to
cause any injury or mischief.634.
