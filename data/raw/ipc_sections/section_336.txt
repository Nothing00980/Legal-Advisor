Voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from his duty.
Whoever voluntarily causes grievous hurt to any person being a public servant in the
discharge of his duty as such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that
person or any other public servant from discharging his duty as such public servant,
or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by that person in the
lawful discharge of his duty as such public servant, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.—
This section provides for the aggravated form of the offence dealt with in the last
section. The hurt caused under it must be grievous. Where the accused gave fist blow
on the face of the victim which caused loosening of one tooth, but the victim was
discharged from the hospital on the same day, moved about throughout the day and
attended his duties the next day, it was held that the injury could not be regarded as
grave and serious. It was a case of simple hurt.874. The basic differences between
sections 333 and 325 IPC, 1860 are that section 325 gets attracted where grievous hurt
is caused, whereas section 333 gets attracted if such hurt is caused to a public
servant.875.
Complainant had sustained grievous hurt while he was on patrolling duty. He was
questioning the unauthorised parking of a pickup van. He was taken inside the van then
kicked and punched. Witnesses corroborated each other on material particulars.
Conviction was upheld.876. Where a police constable was assaulted by unknown
persons and no identification parade was conducted, it was held that accused cannot
be convicted unless it is proved that the injury was inflicted by the accused.877.
The accused was working as a watchman in an office of FCI and misbehaved twice
with members of the staff in respect of which complaints were made to the District
Manager who procured suspension order of the accused from the higher official and
served it on him. The accused attacked and beat the Manager. It was held that it
amounted to preventing and deterring a public servant, from acting in lawful discharge
of his duty and the accused was liable to be convicted under section 333.878.
[s 333.1] Irrationality in sentence.—
It is to be noted that there is terrible irrationality in the sentence prescribed for
committing offences under section 333, IPC, 1860. The said offence is in combination
of offence — defined under section 320 and the offence of assault on a public servant
punishable under section 333, IPC, 1860. The offence of grievous hurt is punishable
under section 326, IPC, 1860 with life imprisonment or with the imprisonment of either
description for a term, which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine.
Whereas a higher form of manifested offence under section 333 is made punishable
only with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years
and shall also be liable to fine. The different types of injuries enumerated under section
320 do not ensue same amount of harm, pain and disability. Therefore, proportionate to
the nature of grievous injuries and its consequences, the punishment should be
redefined. So also the punishment for an offence under section 333 should be
redefined.879.
874. VB Murthy v State of WB, 1995 Cr LJ 1819 (Cal). The accused was required to pay a fine of
Rs. 2000 and released on probation. He was an unemployed young graduate with no criminal
record or leaning. Siyasaran v State of MP, 1995 Cr LJ 2126 (SC), here a fist blow was given to a
surgeon in a Government hospital, benefit of probation was not given because violence against
hospital doctors was not tolerable. The sentence was reduced to the period already undergone
and a fine of Rs. 50,000 was imposed in lieu of compensation. State of MP v Saleem, 2005 Cr LJ
