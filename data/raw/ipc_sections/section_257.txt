Delivery of coin as genuine which, when first possessed, the deliverer
did not know to be altered.
Whoever delivers to any other person as genuine or as a coin of a different description
from what it is, or attempts to induce any person to receive as genuine, or as a
different coin from what it is, any coin in respect of which he knows that any such
operation as that mentioned in section 246, 247, 248 or 249 has been performed, but
in respect of which he did not, at the time when he took it into his possession, know
that such operation had been performed, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine to an amount
which may extend to ten times the value of the coin for which the altered coin is
passed, or attempted to be passed.
COMMENT.â€”
Section 241 corresponds to this section. Where possession is acquired innocently but
on subsequent knowledge that the coin is counterfeit if a person passes it off or
attempts to pass it off as a genuine coin, he will be punished under this section.
