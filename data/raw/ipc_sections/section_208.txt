False personation for purpose of act or proceeding in suit or
prosecution.
Whoever falsely personates another, and in such assumed character makes any
admission or statement, or confesses judgment, 1 or causes any process to be issued
or becomes bail or security, or does any other act in any suit or criminal prosecution,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
The offence punishable under this section is not merely cheating by using a fictitious
name, but by falsely assuming to be some other real person and in that character
making an admission, confessing judgment, or causing any process to be issued, etc.
Any fraudulent gain or a benefit to the offender is not an essential element of this
offence.205. Where A personated B at a trial with B's consent, which was given to save
himself from the trouble of making an appearance in person before a Magistrate, it was
held that A was guilty of an offence under this section, and B was guilty of abetment of
the offence.206. Act of impersonating another for purpose of giving evidence in Court
falls under section 205 IPC, 1860. Section 205, IPC, 1860 is squarely covered under
section 195(b)(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and cognizance could be taken
only by a Court on the complaint in writing of that Court in which such offence was
committed.207.

[s 205.1] Personation of imaginary person.—
There is a conflict of opinion on the point whether a person commits an offence under
this section by personating a purely imaginary person. The Calcutta High Court has
held that a person by such personation commits an offence under this section.208. The
Madras High Court, dissenting from the above ruling, has held that it is not enough to
show the assumption of a fictitious name; it must also appear that the assumed name
was used as a means of falsely representing some other individual.209.
