Punishment for false evidence.
Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding, or
fabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial
proceeding,1 shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine, and whoever
intentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any other case,2 shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years,
and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation 1.—A trial before a Court-martial; 67. [***] is a judicial proceeding.
Explanation 2.—An investigation directed by law preliminary to a proceeding before a
Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may not
take place before a Court of Justice.
ILLUSTRATION
A, in an enquiry before a Magistrate for the purpose of ascertaining whether Z ought to
be committed for trial, makes on oath a statement which he knows to be false. As this
enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A has given false evidence.
Explanation 3.—An investigation directed by a Court of Justice according to law, and
conducted under the authority of a Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial
proceeding, though that investigation may not take place before a Court of Justice.
ILLUSTRATION
A, in any enquiry before an officer deputed by a Court of Justice to ascertain on the
spot the boundaries of land, makes on oath a statement which he knows to be false.
As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding. A has given false evidence.
COMMENT.—
Sections 191 and 192 define the offences punishable under this section. The first
paragraph applies only to cases in which the false evidence is given in a judicial
proceeding, the second to all other cases. If the offence is committed in any stage of a
judicial proceeding it is more severely punishable than when it is committed in a non-
judicial proceeding.
Intention is the essential ingredient in the constitution of this offence. If the statement
was false, and known or believed by the accused to be false, it may be presumed that
in making that statement he intentionally gave false evidence. In order to make a
person liable for perjury it is necessary that he should have made a statement on oath
regarding the facts on which his statement was based and then deny those facts on
oath on a subsequent occasion.68. The mere fact that a deponent has made
contradictory statements at two different stages in a judicial proceeding is not by itself
always sufficient to justify a prosecution for perjury under section 193 but it must be
established that the deponent has intentionally given false statement in any stage of
the 'judicial proceeding' or fabricated false evidence for the purpose of being used in
any stage of the 'judicial proceeding'.69.
It is not necessary that the false statement should be material to the case. The gist of
the offence is the giving or fabrication of false evidence intentionally. Where knowledge
of falsity is proved, intention is readily presumed.70.
1. 'Any stage of a judicial proceeding'.—The recording of a statement under section
161 itself is a judicial proceeding in view of Explanation 2 to section 193 in so far as
recording of a statement is part of the investigation directed by law preliminary to a
proceeding before a Court of justice and therefore is a stage of the judicial
proceedings. Mere failure to support contention made in said FIR while giving evidence
under section 164 Cr PC, 1973, can't conclusively lead to hold that he had given false
evidence by departing from contentions made in FIR.71. Where a witness in Sessions
trial deposing contrary to what he had said in a statement recorded under section 164,
recourse to section 340 cannot be taken without first deciding whether the earlier
statement was false.72. In the course of proceedings for execution of a decree in a
Court which had no jurisdiction to entertain such proceedings the judgment-debtor
made a false statement and produced a forged receipt. The Court made a complaint
under section 195 of the Criminal Procedure Code for prosecution of the judgment-
debtor in respect of the said offences; it was held that if during the course of the
proceedings which were ultra vires and illegal any offence under section 471 of the
Code was committed, it could not be said that it was committed in or in relation to, or
by a party to, any judicial proceedings, in which evidence could be legally taken, and
therefore the complaint must be dismissed.73. Since enquiry conducted by an officer of
the Railway Protection Force is a judicial proceeding under section 9 of The Railway
Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966, furnishing of false documents in course of
such an enquiry would amount to an offence under section 193, IPC, 1860.74. Giving
false evidence in support of the prosecution case during the course of trial falls within
the ambit of sections 193 and 195, IPC, 1860, and not under section 211, IPC, 1860, as
there is no institution of criminal proceeding in such a case.75. (See Comments under
sub-head "Falsely Charges" under section 211 infra.) Where the accused abetted the
offence of forgery by creating a false document with a view to use it in a suit but did
not use it in the suit, it was held that there was no question of prosecuting him under
section 193, IPC, 1860, nor was a Court complaint under section 195(1) (b) (i), Cr PC,
1973, necessary in the case. The accused could be safely prosecuted under section
467 read with section 114, IPC, 1860, on a private complaint.76.
Where the accused police-officer asked a police official to forge the signature of his
superior on the carbon copy of the counter-affidavit containing false averments and the
same was filed in the Supreme Court with that forged signature, the accused was held
guilty of an offence under section 192.77.
Questions which a person is compelled to answer and the answers which have a
tendency to incriminate, cannot be the sole basis of a charge of perjury.78.
[s 193.1] Court Complaint: When?—
In Iqbal Singh Marwah v Meenakshi Marwah,79. the Constitution Bench held that the
section 195(1)(b)(ii) -Cr PC, 1973 which mandates that 'no Court shall take cognizance
of offences relating to documents given in evidence except on the complaint in writing
of that Court, or of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate', would be
attracted only when the offences enumerated in the said provision have been
committed with respect to a document after it has been produced or given in evidence
in a proceedings in any Court, i.e., during the time when the documents was in custodial
legis.80. Though the Rent Controller discharges quasi-judicial functions, he is not a
Court, as understood in the conventional sense and he cannot, therefore, make a
complaint under section 340 Cr PC, 1973.81.
[s 193.2] Belated complaint.—
A witness made false statement before a competent Court and the accused were
convicted. The appellate Court (Sessions Court) held that the witness had given false
statement and directed that a notice be issued to him to show cause why a complaint
under section 193, IPC, 1860 be not filed against him. The notice was issued and after
hearing him, the Court directed that a complaint be filed. The High Court found that the
notice issued to him was no notice because it did not specify the portions that were
found to be false, besides the statement was recorded ten years ago. The Court held
that it was not proper to file a complaint at that stage. The Court set aside the order of
the Sessions Judge.82.
[s 193.3] Supreme Court cannot convert itself into trial Court.—
The accused filed a forged affidavit before the Supreme Court. It was held by the three
Judge Bench that the Supreme Court could not try and convict the accused. The order
of the Supreme Court convicting the accused and sentencing him to three months'
imprisonment was liable to be set aside because of non-compliance of procedure
prescribed by sections 195 and 340, Cr PC, 1973 and also because of lack of original
jurisdiction to try a criminal offence under section 193, IPC, 1860. Directions to the
competent authority to proceed in the matter were not issued because the accused
had already served out the sentence of imprisonment imposed on him.83.
[s 193.4] False Affidavits.—
The swearing of false affidavits in judicial proceedings not only has the tendency of
causing obstruction in the due course of judicial proceedings but has also the tendency
to impede, obstruct and interfere with the administration of justice. The due process of
law cannot be permitted to be slighted nor the majesty of law be made a mockery by
such acts or conduct on the part of the parties to the litigation or even while appearing
as witnesses. Anyone who makes an attempt to impede or undermine or obstruct the
free flow of the unsoiled stream of justice by resorting to the filing of false evidence
commits criminal contempt of the Court and renders himself liable to be dealt with in
accordance with the Act. On facts, High Court found that apart from committing
contempt of Court the accused-1 has also committed an offence of perjury punishable
under section 193, IPC, 1860 committed in relation to proceedings of the Court. Court
directed the Registrar (Judicial) under section 340(3)(b), Cr PC, 1973 to file a complaint
before the jurisdictional Magistrate in this regard.84.
[s 193.5] CASES.—
A father handed over the custody of his minor daughter to the accused woman for
household chores, but thereafter his efforts to get back his daughter failed. He filed a
habeas corpus petition and the Court directed the respondent to produce the girl in
response to which the respondent produced some other girl of the same name to
mislead the Court. The Court directed that a complaint under sections 193, 196 and
199 be lodged against the respondent.85. Declaration in an application filed under
section 482 of Cr PC, 1973 that the applicant had not approached the Supreme Court
or the High Court earlier is not perjury, though applicant had filed for anticipatory Bail
before the Sessions Court.86.
[s 193.6] Hostile witness.—
In a prosecution under sections 489B and 489C, all prosecution witnesses who were
police officials turned hostile. Subsequently they filed affidavits stating that they were
threatened by higher officers not to support their previous statements during
investigation. Court set aside the order of acquittal of the accused, ordered re-trial and
directed to proceed under sections 193 and 195A.87. After a long span of time, the
prosecution witnesses filed a false affidavit stating that they were coerced and tutored
by police. They were held liable for perjury.88.
2. 'In any other case'.—A statement made in the course of a public investigation under
section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure comes within these words.89. Whether
the accused has really made a false statement or not is a question of fact, which can
be decided at the trial and not in quashing proceeding, when the allegations, which
have been made against the accused do make out a prima facie case under section
193, IPC, 1860.90. A person married the daughter of his maternal uncle, after converting
to Christianity. If they married before conversion this marriage would have come under
'Sapindas relations' which is prohibited under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. After
conversion into Christianity the marriage does not fall under 'Sapinda' relationship. It
cannot be said that there was any false declaration. It is held that offence punishable
under section 193 of IPC, 1860 is not made out.91.
[s 193.7] Section 193 IPC, 1860 and Section 125A of the Representation of
Peoples Act, 1950.—
Where a specific penal provision is made under the Act providing a penalty for filing
false affidavit under section 125A of the Act, without anything more, for filing such a
false affidavit, that alone, no prosecution under the general penal provision of section
193 of the Penal Code is entertainable. Furthermore, the penal provision under section
193 IPC, 1860 has to be understood giving significance to the expressions 'intentionally
giving or fabricating false evidence', 'in any stage of a judicial proceeding' or 'in any
other case.' Giving or fabricating false evidence in the aforesaid section whether it be in
the judicial proceeding or in any other case must have been intended to form an
opinion on the evidence erroneously and such forming of opinion should be touching
the point material to the result of such proceeding. Viewed in that angle the declaration
to be made by a candidate in his affidavit filed with his nomination paper over the
matters prescribed by the election commission when he contests an election, it cannot
be stated that the candidate is giving evidence by affidavit but at best only a
declaration on the particulars sought for. If the candidate fails to furnish information or
gives false information which he knows or has reason to believe to be false or conceals
any information he is liable to be prosecuted only for the offence under section 125A of
the Act, and not for the penal offence under section 193 IPC, 1860.92.
[s 193.8] Section 193 IPC, 1860 and proceedings under section 340 Cr PC,
1973.—
Power to punish under section 344 Cr PC, 1973 and section 193 Cr PC, 1973 are
distinct. Section 344 Cr PC, 1973 calls for summary trial, whereas under section 193
IPC, 1860 offender is to be tried as warrant case. Section 344 Cr PC, 1973 vests powers
in the Courts to summarily try and punish the accused. It is for this reason that section
344 Cr PC, 1973 prescribes sentence also. The Judge either should have convicted the
petitioner under section 344 Cr PC, 1973 or ought not to have invoked section 193 IPC,
1860. Once, the Judge opted to try the petitioner for the offence under section 193 IPC,
1860, it was incumbent upon him to hold an inquiry under section 340 Cr PC, 1973 and
then to frame a charge and try the offender for a warrant case as minimum sentence
prescribed under section 193 IPC, 1860 is three years.93. Before lodging a complaint as
provided by section 340 of the Code, the Court has to record a finding of any (i) prima
facie case and deliberate falsehood on a matter of substance; (ii) there is reasonable
foundation for the charge; and (iii) it is expedient in the interest of justice that a
complaint should be filed.94. An enquiry when made, under section 340 (1) Cr PC, 1973,
is really in the nature of affording a locus paenitentiae to a person and if at that stage
the Court chooses to take action, it does not mean that he will not have full and
adequate opportunity in due course of the process of justice to establish his
innocence. When the trial of the appellant commences under section 193, IPC, 1860
the reasons given or those in the order passed under section 340 (1), Cr PC, 1973
should not weigh with the criminal Court in coming to its independent conclusion
whether the offence under section 193, IPC, 1860 has been fully established against
the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.95.
