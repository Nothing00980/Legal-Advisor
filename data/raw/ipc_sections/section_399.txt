imprisonment for life, etc.
Whoever commits extortion by putting any person in fear of an accusation against
that person or any other, of having committed or attempted to commit any offence
punishable with death, or with 136.[imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment for a
term which may extend to ten years or of having attempted to induce any other person
to commit such offence, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for
a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and, if the
offence be one punishable under section 377 of this Code, may be punished with 137.
[imprisonment for life].
COMMENTâ€”
It is immaterial whether the person against whom the accusation is threatened be
innocent or guilty, if the prisoner intended to extort money. The aggravating
circumstance under this section is the threat of an accusation of an offence punishable
with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for ten years. If the accusation is of
unnatural offence then the penalty provided is severer.
