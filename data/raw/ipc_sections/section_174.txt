COMMENT—
Wearing garb or token of public servant.—Under this section the offence is complete,
although no act is done or attempted in the assumed official character. The mere
circumstance of wearing a garb, or carrying a token, with the intention or knowledge
supposed, is sufficient. It is not necessary that something should pass in words. If any
act is done then the preceding section will apply.
Under section 140 IPC, 1860, wearing the garb or carrying the token of a soldier is
made punishable.
