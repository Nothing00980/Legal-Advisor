COMMENTâ€”
This section is similar to sections 449 and 450. It provides punishment for house-
trespass committed with intent to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment.
Where the accused was convicted of house-breaking, his object being to have sexual
intercourse with the complainant's wife, it was held that the conviction was valid.703.
The accused was held to be guilty of the offence under section 450 (lurking house-
trespass where he entered the house at mid-night getting easy access because of
acquaintance with the family and forcibly raped the victim girl finding her alone in her
room. He was punished for rape and lurking house-trespass for committing an
offence.704. Accused persons committed house trespass in order to commit an
offence punishable with imprisonment. They went to the house of complainant with
preparation by holding sticks in their hands for assaulting the complainant. Therefore,
all the four accused are liable to be convicted under section 451 of the IPC, 1860.705.
Where evidence shows that accused after entering the house unlawfully remained
there and had even intimidated and insulted and annoyed the victim when they were
called upon to quit the house. Court held that conduct of the accused will clearly come
within the latter part of section 441 IPC, 1860 and the same will be punishable under
section 451 IPC, 1860.706. There is enough material to show that the appellant had
committed house trespass, however, not with intention to commit offence punishable
with life imprisonment, hence, in such case section 451 IPC, 1860 would be attracted
instead of section 450.707. The accused trespassed into the house of the victim girl
who was nearly about ten years of age on the date of occurrence and committed
unnatural offence on her. After finding the victim alone in the house the accused
committed unnatural offence by putting his penis having carnal intercourse against
order of nature. Order of acquittal is reversed by the Supreme Court.708.
It was alleged that the accused trespassed into the house of the victim when she was
all alone in order to commit rape. But there was no evidence of any preparation or
attempt to rape. The conviction under section 452 was held to be not proper. Since the
trespass was not for any pious purpose because an offence under section 354
(outraging modesty) was likely to be involved, conviction was recorded under section
451.709. In another case the Courts below observed that from the evidence of PWs 1
and 2 it is seen that theft had taken place in the room in which PW 2 was sleeping; the
thief entered the house and committed theft of gold chain which PW 2 was wearing
and, therefore, this act will be covered by section 451 of the IPC, 1860, i.e., house-
trespass in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment. A1 and A3 have
been acquitted because nothing links them to the offence. But, similar is the case with
the appellant. The only evidence against him is the alleged recovery of gold chain at his
instance. That cannot connect the appellant to the offence.710.
The accused was convicted for house trespass for committing unnatural offence. The
accused was convicted by the trial court but acquitted by the High Court because of no
corroboration of the testimony of the victim. The Supreme Court restored the
conviction and observed that corroboration could not be required as a fossil formula,
even if the story revealed by the victim appeals to the judicial mind as probable.711.
