Solitary confinement.
Whenever any person is convicted of an offence for which under this Code the Court
has power to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment, the Court may, by its sentence,
order that
the offender shall be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of the
imprisonment to which he is sentenced, not exceeding three months in the whole,
according to the following scale, that is to say—
a time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six
months;
a time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months
and 244.[shall not exceed one] year;
a time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year.
COMMENT—
Solitary confinement amounts to keeping the prisoner thoroughly isolated from any
kind of contact with the outside world. It is inflicted in order that a feeling of loneliness
may produce wholesome influence and reform the criminal. This section gives the
scale according to which solitary confinement may be inflicted. Where the petitioner, an
undertrial prisoner, who was arrested in connection with the assassination of a former
Prime Minister was put in a separate cell only as a precautionary measure, to ensure
his non-mingling with other prisoners and for his security, it was held that it did not
amount either to solitary confinement or cellular confinement.245. The well-known
principle of law is that the convict carrying death punishment is not deemed to be
'prisoner under sentence of death' unless death sentence becomes final, conclusive
and beyond judicial scrutiny. Such convict is handed over to the jail authority to be kept
in safe and protected custody with purpose that he may be available for execution of
the sentence eventually confirmed. This custody is different from custody of a convict
suffering from simple or rigorous imprisonment. Therefore, he cannot be kept in Cell or
solitary confinement which itself is a separate punishment.246.
[s 73.1] Convicts on death row.—
The question about solitary confinement or keeping condemned prisoner alone under
strict guard as provided in various jail manual has been considered in depth by the
Constitution Bench in Sunil Batra v Delhi Administration247. and Triveniben v State of
Gujarat.248. In Batra's case, it has been held that if the prisoner under sentence of death
is held in jail custody, punitive detention cannot be imposed upon him by jail authorities
except for prison offences. When a prisoner is committed under a warrant for jail
custody under section 366(2) Cr PC, 1973 and if he is detained in solitary confinement
which is a punishment prescribed by section 73, IPC, 1860 it will amount to imposing
punishment for the same offence more than once which would be violative of Article
20(2). Practice of keeping prisoners in condemned cell before confirmation is a pre-
constitutional practice and such practices should be avoided. Therefore, practice
adopted in the jail until now cannot be a ground of putting the petitioners in solitary
confinement or separate condemned cells.249.
The Supreme Court in Shatrughan Chauhan v UOI250. held that to be 'under sentence of
death' means 'to be under a finally executable death sentence'. The Court, in this case
also issued guidelines for safeguarding the rights of the death row convicts.
