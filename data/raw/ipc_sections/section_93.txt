Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused
against his will.
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by
reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing
what is either wrong, or contrary to law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him
was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.
COMMENT.—
Under this section a person will be exonerated from liability for doing an act while in a
state of intoxication if he at the time of doing it, by reason of intoxication, was
(1) incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or
(2) that he was doing what was either wrong or contrary to law;
Provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his
knowledge or against his will.185.
Voluntary drunkenness is no excuse for the commission of a crime.186. A person
cannot become himself drunk with liquor and commit an offence and then come and
say that he had consumed the liquor and, therefore, the benefit of section 85 should be
given to him.187. The law pronounces that the obscuration and divestment of that
judgment and human feeling which in a sober state would have prevented the accused
from offending, shall not, when produced by his voluntary act, screen him from
punishment, although he be no longer capable of self-restraint.188. It is also no excuse
to say that because of it he failed to resist the impulse to act in a certain way189. or
that because of it he acted like an automaton.190.
[s 85.1] Voluntary drunkenness.—when an excuse.—
Nevertheless voluntary drunkenness is a factor which has to be taken into
consideration at least in two types of cases, viz.,
(i) where a specific intent is an essential element of an offence charged and the
evidence shows that the state of intoxication of the accused is such that he is
incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute the crime.191. In the
Indian context, for example, it would be intent to kill as in clauses 1, 2, and 3 of section
300, IPC, 1860. In such cases, however, even if the accused fails to actually form the
specific intent, section 86, IPC, 1860, would impute the necessary guilty knowledge to
him and he would, therefore, be liable for culpable homicide not amounting to murder
though not of murder.192. Thus, voluntary intoxication amounting to prove incapacity to
form the required specific intent would be a limited excuse to reduce an offence of
murder (section 302) to one of culpable homicide not amounting murder (section 304,
IPC, 1860). This is, however, a question of fact in each case.
In a case of wife-burning, her dying declaration disclosed that her husband consumed
liquor, scolded her and then set her afire after pouring kerosene on her. She fought the
fire and tried to run away but the accused again caught hold of her and again poured oil
and inflamed her. It was held that these circumstances showed that the mental
faculties of the accused were not impaired to such an extent that he was prevented
from forming the requisite intention to cause death. He was convicted under section
302 and not section 304, Part II.193.
(ii) where habitual drunkenness has resulted in such a diseased condition of the mind
that the accused is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing what
is either wrong or contrary to law. In such a case M'Naughten Rules (section 84, IPC,
1860) would come into play and he would be absolved from liability.194. The most
common example of such an alcoholic disease is "Delirium Tremens" which is
produced by prolonged and habitual excessive drinking and results in loss of the
faculty of reasoning or serious defect of reasoning. In other words, "insanity, whether
produced by drunkenness or otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged."195.
Under this section if a man is made drunk through stratagem or the fraud of others, or
through ignorance, or through any other means causing intoxication without the man's
knowledge or against his will, he is excused.196.
[s 85.2] CASE.—
The accused ravished a girl of 13 years of age and, in furtherance of the act of rape,
placed his hand upon her mouth and his thumb upon her throat, thereby causing death
by suffocation. The sole defence was a plea of drunkenness. It was held that
drunkenness was no defence unless it could be established that the accused at the
time of committing rape was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent to
commit it (which was not alleged), inasmuch as the death resulted from a succession
of acts, the rape and the act of violence causing suffocation, which could not be
regarded independently of each other; and that the accused was guilty of murder.197.
Drink is an aggravating feature in the award of sentence. In reference to one of the
accused persons there was no evidence to establish that the effect of intoxication was
such as to cause him to lack the specific intent for murder, particularly in view of the
fact that, on his own admission, he was following instructions given by the other
accused and he was able to give the police a lucid account of his actions. The degree
of intoxication fell far below that which would preclude the formation of specific intent
required for murder.198.

[LNIND 2006 SC 1134] : 2007 Cr LJ 1160 , the Court stated three propositions as to the scope of
the section:
(i) the insanity whether produced by drunkenness or otherwise is a defence to the crime
charged;
(ii) evidence of drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific
intent essential to constitute the crime should be taken into account with the other facts
proved in order to determine whether or not he had this intent; and
(iii) the evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form
the intent necessary to constitute the crime and merely establishing that his mind is
affected by drink so that he more readily gave to some violent passion, does not rebut
the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.
