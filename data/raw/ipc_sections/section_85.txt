Act of Judge when acting judicially.
Nothing is an offence which is done by a Judge when acting judicially in the exercise
of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to him by law.
COMMENT.â€”
Under this section a Judge is exempted not only in those cases in which he proceeds
irregularly in the exercise of a power which the law gives him, but also in cases where
he, in good faith, exceeds his jurisdiction and has no lawful powers. It protects judges
from criminal process just as the Judicial Officers Protection Act, 1850, saves them
from civil suits. Judicial Officers' Protection Act affords protection to two broad
categories of acts done or ordered to be done by a judicial officer in his judicial
capacity. In the first category fall those acts which are within the limits of his
jurisdiction. The second category encompasses those acts which may not be within
the jurisdiction of the judicial officer, but are, nevertheless, done or ordered to be done
by him, believing in good faith that he had jurisdiction to do them or order them to be
done.11.
A Collector who exercises powers of enquiry and award under the Land Acquisition Act,
1894 is not acting judicially because he is not a judge. He is not entitled to the
protection of section 77.12. Regional Provident Fund Commissioner while passing order
under section 7-A of 1952 Act is entitled to get protection as envisaged under section
77 of IPC, 1860 and section 3(1) of Judges (Protection) Act, 1985.13.
