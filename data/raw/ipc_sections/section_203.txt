Using as true such declaration knowing it to be false.
Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to use as true any such declaration, knowing the
same to be false in any material point, shall be punished in the same manner as if he
gave false evidence.
Explanation.—A declaration which is inadmissible merely upon the ground of some
informality, is a declaration within the meaning of sections 199 to 200.
