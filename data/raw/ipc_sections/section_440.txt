Mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc., of any value or any animal of
the value of fifty rupees.
Whoever commits mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless, any
elephant, camel, horse, mule, buffalo, bull, cow or ox, whatever may be the value
thereof, or any other animal of the value of fifty rupees or upwards, shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, or
with fine, or with both.
COMMENT—
This section provides for enhanced punishment owing to the greater value of the
animals mentioned therein. This section is applicable where permanent injury is
caused to the animal by the offence of mischief.637. It has been held by the Supreme
Court that the offence created by this section and the one under section 9(1) read with
section 50 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 are substantially the same offence.
Therefore, the bar of double jeopardy will not operate.638. It is apparent that the most
significant words are the opening words of the section which says, "whoever commits
mischief by killing..." and thus 'mischief' appears to be an essential ingredient for
attracting the offence and the mischief has been defined under section 425 of the IPC,
1860. For constituting offence of mischief the essential ingredient would be the
destruction of the property. Therefore, if no one has any property or right in any animal,
the killing of that animal does not come within the purview of section 425 of the Code
and thus, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case where the complainant
has never come with the case that any dog over which somebody has right, has been
caught, rather according to complaint, only stray dogs have been caught that too where
it has never been alleged to have been poisoned, maimed or rendered useless there
would be no application of section 429 of the IPC, 1860.639.
[s 429.1] Cruelty to animals.—
Though the complainant under the allegations made in the complaint petition made
prayer to take cognizance of the offence under sections 11 (i) (a)(b)(c)(e)(f)(g)(h)(i)
and (1) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and also under section 429 of
the IPC, 1860 but the Court did not find any ground to proceed with the case so far
offence under section 429 of the IPC, 1860 is concerned and hence, he did not take any
cognizance of the said offence, still the petitioner has been summoned to face trial not
only for the offence under sections 11 (i)(a)(b)(c)(e)(f)(g)(h)(i) and (l) of the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 but also under section 429 of the IPC, 1860 and
therefore, any insertion of the offence under section 429 of the IPC, 1860 in the
summon under the facts and circumstances stated above is an error which may have
crept in inadvertently but otherwise also in the fact of allegation there would be no
application of section 429 of the IPC, 1860.640.
