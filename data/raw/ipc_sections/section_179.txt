legally bound to give it.
Whoever, being legally bound to give any notice or to furnish information on any

furnish such information in the manner and at the time required by law, shall be
punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month, or
with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both;
or, if the notice or information required to be given respects the commission of an
offence, or is required for the purpose of preventing the commission of an offence, or
in order to the apprehension of an offender, with simple imprisonment for a term
which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand
rupees, or with both;
33.[or, if the notice or information required to be given is required by an order passed
under sub-section (1) of section 565 (now 356) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898 (now 1973)34. with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

COMMENT.—
Omission to give notice or information.—This section applies to persons upon whom
an obligation is imposed by law to furnish certain information to public servants, and
the penalty which the law provides is intended to apply to parties who commit an
intentional breach of such obligation,35. and not where the public servants have already
obtained the information from other sources.36.
A doctor is not obliged to inform the police when he treats a patient who has met with
vehicle accident.37.
[s 176.1] CASE.—
It was not within the scope of the Magistrate to hold investigative officer guilty for
violation of his official duties who had already sought extension to complete the
investigation. Omission on the part of IO to complete the investigation within 60 days
from date of arrest is not covered under provisions of section 176, IPC, 1860.38. Under
section 39 (i)(v) Cr PC, 1973, where a person is aware of commission or an intention to
commit an offence under sections 302, 303 and 304, IPC, 1860, he is bound to give
information to the nearest Magistrate or police-officer of such commission or intention
and failure to do so is punishable under this section. Where the mother of a murder
suspect merely said that her son and daughter-in-law went to bed at about 10 P.M. and
that early next morning, her son came out and ran away and she found her daughter-in-
law lying dead on the bed, it was held that her failure to inform the police did not
constitute an offence under section 176, IPC, 1860, as she was neither aware that a
murder was going to be committed nor aware that a murder had been committed.39.
