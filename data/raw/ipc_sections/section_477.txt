Forgery of record of Court or of public register, etc.
42. [Whoever forges a document or an electronic record], purporting to be a record or
proceeding of or in a Court of Justice, or a register of birth, baptism, marriage or
burial, or a register kept by a public servant as such, or a certificate or document
purporting to be made by a public servant in his official capacity, or an authority to
institute or defend a suit, or to take any proceedings therein, or to confess judgment,
or a power of attorney, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
43.[Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, "register" includes any list, data or
record of any entries maintained in the electronic form as defined in clause (r) of sub-
section (1) of section 2 of the Information Technology Act, 2000].
COMMENT.—
Forging a document and using the forged document are quite different and distinct
offence. The reliance on the false documents will not ipso facto implicate the person
who relied upon, under sections 465 and 466.44. If by virtue of preparing a false
document purporting it to be a document of a Court of Justice and by virtue of such
document, a person who is not entitled to be released on bail could be released then,
undoubtedly damage or injury has been caused to the public at large and, therefore,
there is no reason why under such circumstances the accused who is the author of
such forged document cannot be said to have committed offence under section 466 of
IPC, 1860. A person is said to do a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to
defraud but not otherwise. The expression 'defraud' involves two elements, namely
deceit and injury to the person deceived. Injury is something other than economic loss
and it will include any harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind, reputation or
such others. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver will almost always cause loss or
detriment to the deceived. The preparation of a forged bail order by the utilisation of
which the person concerned obtained an advantage of being released deceiving the
courts and the society at large cannot but be said to have made the document
fraudulently, thereby attracting section 466 of IPC, 1860.45.
