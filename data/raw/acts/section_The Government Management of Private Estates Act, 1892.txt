The Government Management of Private Estates Act, 1892
Act 
No. 10 of 1892
1865.
 


Statement of Objects and Reasons. - "In several provinces a general rate is already levied on estates under the Court of Wards, and is credited to Government to meet the estimated costs of supervision and management by Government Officers. It is desirable to place the legality of these rates beyond doubt: and at the same time to limit their amount. It has been decided that other Local Governments should be empowered to levy similar rates, and that the rates should he leviable on all estates under Government management and not merely on those under the Court of Wards.
Power has been given to the Local Governments to reduce or remit the rate in special cases. This provision is designed especially to meet cases in which Government officials are relieved of the supervision and management by the employment of special general managers. Under Section 4 of the Bill it is open to Local Governments either to charge special fees for legal advice and audit of accounts where these services arc rendered by Government Officials, or to debit the contribution for these services to the general rate." - Gazette of India, 1892, Part V. page 14.
