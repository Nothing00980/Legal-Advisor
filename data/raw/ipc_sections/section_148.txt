Wearing garb or carrying token used by soldier, sailor or airman.
Whoever, not being a soldier, 47.[sailor or airman], in the Military, 48.[Naval or Air]
service of the 49.[Government of India], wears any garb or carries any token
resembling any garb or token used by such a soldier, 50.[sailor or airman] with the
intention that it may be believed that he is such a soldier, 51.[sailor or airman], shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.
COMMENT—
Wearing garb or carrying token.—The gist of the offence herein made penal is the
intention of the accused wearing the dress of a soldier for the purpose of inducing
others to believe that he is in service at the present time. Merely wearing a soldier's
garb without any specific intention is no offence. Cast-off uniforms of soldiers are worn
by many men. Actors put on different military uniforms.
