Taking gift, etc., to screen an offender from punishment—.
Whoever accepts or attempts to obtain, or agrees to accept, any gratification for
himself or any other person, or any restitution of property to himself or any other
person, in consideration of his concealing an offence or of his screening any person
from legal punishment for any offence, or of his not proceeding against any person
for the purpose of bringing him to legal punishment,
if a capital offence;
shall, if the offence is punishable with death, be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be
liable to fine;
if punishable with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment.
and if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment
which may extend to ten years, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to
fine;
and if the offence is punishable with imprisonment not extending to ten years,
shall be punished with imprisonment of the description provided for the offence
for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term of
imprisonment provided for the offence, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
The compounding of a crime, by some agreement not to bring the criminal to justice if
the property is restored or a pecuniary or other gratification is given, is the offence
punished by this and the following sections. It is the duty of every State to punish
criminals. No individual has, therefore, a right to compound a crime because he himself
is injured and no one else.
[s 213.1] Ingredients.—
The section has two essentials:
1. A person accepting or attempting to obtain any gratification or restitution of property
for himself or any other person.
2. Such gratification must have been obtained in consideration of (a) concealing an
offence, or (b) screening any person from legal punishment for an offence, or (c) not
proceeding against a person for the purpose of bringing him to legal punishment. The
most important ingredient of the charge, under section 213, viz., is that the payment
was in relation to the interference with the course of a judicial proceeding and the
tampering with the evidence.288.
[s 213.2] Scope.—
According to the Calcutta High Court this section applies only where there has been an
actual concealment of an offence, or screening of a person from legal punishment, or
abstention from proceeding criminally against a person, and, as consideration for the
same, there has been an acceptance of, or attempt to obtain, or agreement to accept,
any gratification or restitution of property. It has no application where only an
acceptance of or attempt to obtain, or agreement to accept, any gratification or
restitution on a promise to conceal, screen or abstain, is proved and nothing more.289.
The Bombay High Court has dissented from this view and has held that this section
does not require the actual concealment of an offence or the screening of any person
from legal punishment or the actual forbearing of taking any proceedings. It is
sufficient if an illegal gratification is received in consideration of a promise to conceal
an offence or screen any person from legal punishment or desist from taking any
proceedings.290.
The section does not apply where the compounding of an offence is legal.
[s 213.3] Mere suspicion.—
This section is applicable only when it is proved that the person screened or attempted
to be screened from legal punishment has been guilty of an offence, and not when
there is merely a suspicion of his having committed some offence.291.
