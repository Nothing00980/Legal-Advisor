Public servant negligently suffering such prisoner to escape.
Whoever, being a public servant and having the custody of any State prisoner or
prisoner of war, negligently suffers such prisoner to escape from any place of
confinement in which such prisoner is confined, shall be punished with simple
imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to
fine.
COMMENT—
Negligently suffering prisoners to escape.—The offence under this section is like the
one provided in section 128. Under it the escape of the prisoner should be owing to the
negligence of the public servant. Section 128 punishes a public servant who voluntarily
allows a State prisoner to escape. Section 223 punishes the escape of an ordinary
prisoner under similar circumstances.
