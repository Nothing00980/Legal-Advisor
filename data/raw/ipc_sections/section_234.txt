Counterfeiting coin.
Whoever counterfeits or knowingly performs any part of the process of counterfeiting
coin, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Explanation.—A person commits this offence who intending to practise deception, or
knowing it to be likely that deception will thereby be practised, causes a genuine coin
to appear like a different coin.
COMMENT.—
It is not necessary under this section that the counterfeit coin should be made with the
primary intention of its being passed as genuine; it is sufficient if the resemblance to
genuine coin is so close that it is capable of being passed as such.7. It is not essential
for coins to be counterfeit that they should be of exact resemblances to genuine coins.
It is sufficient that they are such as to cause deception and may be passed as
genuine.8. But where the alleged counterfeit coins are such that none would be
deceived, these cannot be counterfeit coins within the meaning of this section.9.
