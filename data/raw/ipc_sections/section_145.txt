Deserter concealed on board, merchant vessel through negligence of
master.
The master or person in charge of a merchant vessel, on board of which any deserter
from the Army, 35.[Navy or Air Force] of the 36.[Government of India] is concealed,
shall, though ignorant of such concealment, be liable to a penalty not exceeding five
hundred rupees, if he might have known of such concealment but for some neglect of
his duty as such master or person in charge, or but for some want of discipline on
board of the vessel.
COMMENT—
Concealment on board.—This section punishes the master or person in charge of a
merchant ship on board of which a deserter has concealed himself. The master is
liable even though he is ignorant of such concealment. But some negligence or laxity in
the maintenance of discipline on the part of the master has to be made out.
