Public servant unlawfully engaging in trade.
Whoever, being a public servant, and being legally bound as such public servant not to
engage in trade, engages in trade, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a
term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT—
Public servant engaging in trade.—This section punishes those public servants who
are legally bound not to engage in trade. If public servants were allowed to trade they
would fail to perform their duties with undivided attention. Being in official position they
could easily obtain unfair advantages over other traders.
The word 'trade' covers every kind of trade, business, profession, or occupation.9. This
proposition of law no longer seems to be correct in view of the Supreme Court's
decision in Mahesh Kumar Dhirajlal's case10. wherein their Lordships held that trade in
its narrow sense means "exchange of goods for goods or for money with the object of
making profit" and in its widest sense means "any business with a view to earn profit".
Thus, where a tracer in the office of Sub-divisional Soil Conservation Officer took
earned leave and during that period of leave obtained training as an Electrical Signal
Maintainer from the Railway Administration, it was held that he could not be convicted
under this section as he had not engaged himself in any trade even though he was
receiving stipend from the Railways during the period of his training.11. Following this
ruling, it has been held that engaging oneself as an agent of an insurance company on
commission basis does not amount to engaging in trade.12.
[s 168.1] Private Practice of Government Doctors.—
In Kanwarjit Singh Kakkar v State of Punjab,13. the Supreme Court examined the
question whether the indulgence in private practice of Government Doctors would
amount to indulgence in 'trade' while holding the post of a government doctor, so as to
constitute an offence under section 168 of the IPC, 1860. The Supreme Court held that
"in our view, offence under Section 168 of the IPC, 1860 cannot be held to have been
made out against the appellants even under this Section as the treatment of patients
by a doctor cannot by itself be held to be engagement in a trade as the doctors' duty to
treat patients is in the discharge of his professional duty which cannot be held to be a
'trade' so as to make out or constitute an offence under Section 168 of the IPC, 1860".
