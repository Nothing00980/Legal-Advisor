Mischief by destroying or moving, etc., a land-mark fixed by public
authority.
Whoever commits mischief by destroying or moving any land-mark fixed by the
authority of a public servant, or by any act which renders such land-mark less useful
as such, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENTâ€”
This section is similar to the last section but the punishment prescribed is not so
severe because tampering with land-marks does not lead to disastrous results.
Possession by the accused of the land in which the land-marks are situated will not be
a defence in a case where the ingredients of the offence under this section are made
out.642.
