The Aircraft Act, 1934
(22 OF 1934)
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-Aerial navigation in British India is at present  governed by the Indian Aircraft Act, 1911, and the rules made thereunder. In 1919 an  International Convention for the regulation of aerial Navigation was signed by the  plenipotentiaries of 27 countries with the object of establishing regulations of universal  application and of encouraging peaceful intercourse with nations by means of aerial  communications. To this Convention India was a signatory.
The Convention deals with all questions relating to international aerial navigation, and  also provides for the institution of a permanent International Commission for Air  Navigation with very wide powers as regards the formulation of rules for the marking of  aircraft, the grant of certificates, rules of the air and so forth. This Commission meets from  time to time to amend the annexes of the Convention, which contain the detailed rules to be  observed by the aircraft of all signatory States and by all aircrafts when within the borders of  those States.
For some years past the inadequacy of the Indian Aircraft Act, 1911, has been  increasingly felt, and the stage has now been reached where it is no longer possible to  control air traffic efficiently, or to implement India's international obligations without fresh  legislation. The present Bill, therefore, is designed to enlarge the rule making powers of the  Governor-General in Council in order to meet modem developments to enable Government  to give full effect to the provisions of the International Convention and its annexes, and to  provide for certain other matters on which legislation has become necessary.
Amendment Act 1 of 1983-Statement of Objects and Reasons.-Section 5 of the Aircraft  Act, 1934 empowers the Central Government to make rules providing inter alia for the  regulation of air transport services and the authorities by which powers conferred by or  under the Act may be exercised. The committee on subordinate legislation of the Sixth Lok  Sabha (12th Report) have recommended that the section might be suitably amended so that  authority expressly flows therefrom for authorising the Director-General of Civil Aviation  to approve, disapprove or revise the fares, etc., of the tariffs of operators of air transport  services. It is proposed to give effect to this recommendation by amending sub-section (2) of  section 5 of the Act so as to enumerate therein expressly the matters mentioned by the  Committee and all other important matters regarding the economic regulation of civil aviation and air transport services and matters with respect to which rules may be made  tinder the section.
2. It is proposed to avail of the present opportunity to amend section 14-A of the Act  relaxing-to laying of rules before Parliament so as to bring the same into conformity with the  latest formula on the subject as approved by the committee on subordinate legislation.
Amendment Act 69 of 1985-Statement of Objects and Reasons.-Section 14 of the  Aircraft Act, 1934, as originally enacted provided that the power to make rules conferred by  the Act "is subject to the condition of the rules being made after previous publication for a  period of not less than three months". As a result of this provision, except in cases falling  under section 8-B of the Act, it was not possible to make rules for the purposes of the Act  without previous publication of the same for a period of not less than three months.
2. In connection with the formal investigation into the accident involving that crash of  Air India's Being 747-237-B Aircraft VT-EFO "Kanishka" on the 23rd June, 1985 in the North  Atlantic sea, the Court holding the investigation recommended that the Aircraft Rules, 1937  should be amended without delay to facilitate the holding of some of the proceedings of the  Court in camera. In view of the urgency of the matter and with a view to covering all  contingencies in which it may not be practicable to comply with the condition of previous  publication for three months, the President promulgated on the 16th October, 1985 the  Aircraft (Amendment) Ordinance, 1985 for substituting for section 14 of the Act a new  section. The new section retains the condition of previous publication of rules made under  the Act without laying down any minimum period of such publication. It also empowers  the Central Government to dispense with, in the public interest, the condition of previous  publication in any case.
Amendment Act 51 of 2000-Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The movement of a  cargo in India is, at present, subjected to physical examination, X-ray screening, or 24 hours  cooling off. These security procedures prescribed for the movement of cargo entail wastage  of time and energy since the consignment cannot be straightaway carried into the aircraft.
2. It has been felt over a period of time that the above procedure is tedious and has been  hindering the speedy movement of air cargo. With a view to remedying the situation, the  Government of India has decided to introduce the scheme called the "Known Shippers"  under which the prescribed security measures could be adopted by the identified "Known  Shippers" at their own site and cargo consignment could be accepted directly by air carriers  on the basis of their certification stating that the consignment is safe for air transportation.
3. The implementation of the scheme will be subject to satisfactory observance of security  norms by he "Known Shippers". In order to enforce the scheme, a notification will be issued  by the Commissioner of Security (Civil Aviation) under section 5-A of the Aircraft Act, 1934,  in consultation with the Central Government. The violation of directions issued under the  said notification shall be punishable tinder section 11-A of the said Act. As the punishment  'provided under section 11-A is not deterrent enough, it is proposed to amend that section so  as to enhance the upper limit of fine from one thousand rupees to ten lakh rupees.
Amendment Act 44 of 2008-Statement of Objects and Reasons.-At present the Central  Government through various provisions of the Aircraft Act, 1934 and the rules made  thereunder exercises control in respect of manufacture, possession, use, operation, sale,  import and export of civil aircrafts and licensing of aerodromes.
2. In the last two decades, significant developments have taken place in the civil aviation  sector in India. The domestic air transport services were opened to the private sector in 1994  and the management and operation of the airports, the navigation, communication facilities  and the air traffic control at airports were transferred to the Airports Authority of India  with effect from the 1st April, 1995. Now, with vast developments in technology,  communication, navigation, surveillance and air traffic management are switching over  from ground based to satellite based technology. As a result of these developments, a need  has arisen to lay down appropriate safeguards to ensure protection of civil aviation against  acts of unlawful interference.
3. Keeping in view the above aspects as well as standards laid down by the International  Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) for safety and security of civil aviation and also to give effect to various provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation popularly  known as Chicago Convention, certain amendments are proposed to be made to the Aircraft  Act, 1934.
4. The Aircraft (Amendment) Bill, 2006, inter alia, seeks-
(a) to regulate foreign registered aircraft which is for the time being operating in or over India;
(b) to empower the Central Government for
(i) licensing of personnel engaged in air traffic control;
(ii) certification, inspection and regulation of communication, navigation and surveillance and air traffic management;
(iii) safeguarding civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference and to ensure civil aviation security; and
(iv) investigation of incident alongwith accident;
(c) to empower the Director-General of Civil Aviation for performing safety oversight functions;
(d) to impose penalty for contravention of the provisions of the Chicago Convention;
(e) to enhance quantum of existing penalties for violation of rules relating to carriage in aircraft of arms of explosives or providing false information or abetment of offences or non-compliance of directions with a view to achieve desired deterrent effect which would go a long way in raising the compliance level;
(f) to enlarge the scope of the powers of Director-General of Civil Aviation.
