House-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint.
Whoever commits house-trespass, having made preparation for causing hurt to any
person, or for assaulting any person, or for wrongfully restraining any person, or for
putting any person in fear of hurt, or of assault, or of wrongful restraint, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENTâ€”
The Legislature has enacted this section to provide higher punishment where house-
trespass is committed in order to cause hurt, or to assault, or to wrongfully restrain any
person. For a conviction under this section, it is necessary to prove that the dominant
intention of the accused was to cause hurt to or to assault or to wrongfully restrain any
person.712. Preparation is the genesis of offence under section 452 of IPC, 1860. In
absence of it being proved that any device as a metal rod, crow bar or even a stick was
used by the accused due to which it could be described as "preparation for commission
of offence," it appears to be impossible to hold that there exists adequate material even
to frame the charge for offence under section 452 of IPC, 1860.713. Criminal trespass is
committed by the accused when they entered the house of an individual with a view to
insult, intimidate or annoy such owner of the house/property. If the accused entered
the house of an individual to insult, intimidate or annoy any person other than the
owner of the property, it would not constitute criminal trespass. Once the conduct of
the accused is not criminal trespass, it would not be house trespass and would not
become punishable under section 452 IPC, 1860.714.

3178 (HP), murder, rioting and house trespass, conviction. Raghunandan Pd. v State of UP, 1998
Cr LJ 1571 (All), probably accused persons were in possession and complainants fired at them
causing gunshot injuries thus, the accused persons had the right of private defence of person
and property and were given the benefit of doubt. See also Jai Narain v State of Rajasthan, 1998
Cr LJ 2199 (Raj); Devkaran v State of Rajasthan, 1998 Cr LJ 3883 (Raj). Rala Singh v State, 1997
Cr LJ 1313 (P&H), in a charge of trespass and kidnapping against the accused persons, the
victim gave her age to be 20 years. She was examined but not subjected to ossification test.
School leaving certificate showed her age to be 18 but her parents were not examined for
corroboration. Guilt not proved beyond reasonable doubt.
713. Subhash Sahebrao Datkar v State of Maharashtra, 2011 Cr LJ 736 (Bom); Chandreee v State
2011 (3) Crimes 215 (Raj)-although there is no evidence on record that the present accused
Chandraee entered the house of the complainant with any preparation, therefore, the essential
fact of preparation is missing in the evidence and in the absence of any preparation, the offence
under section 452 IPC, 1860 cannot be said to be made out and thus, the offence of the
accused petitioner comes within the purview of section 451 IPC, 1860.
