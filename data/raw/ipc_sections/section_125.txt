COMMENT—
Abetting by public or more than ten persons.—Abetment has a reference both to the
person or persons abetted, and to the offence or offences the commission of which is
abetted. This section deals with former, whatever may be the nature of the offence
abetted, while section 115 deals with the latter without having regard to the person or
persons abetted.117.
Under this section it will be sufficient to show any instigation or other mode of
abetment, though neither the effect intended, nor any other effect follows from it. The
gravamen of a charge under this section is the abetment itself, the instigation to
general lawlessness, not the particular offence of which the commission is
instigated.118. The section covers all offences and is a general provision for abetment
of any number of persons exceeding ten. When more than ten persons are instigated to
commit an offence punishable with death, the offence comes under section 115 as
well as this section.119. Abetment of the commission of murder, whether by a single
individual or by a class of persons exceeding ten, falls under section 115. In the latter
case, it may fall under this section also, but as this section prescribes a lesser
punishment, section 115 is the more appropriate provision for such an offence.
Although both the sections are applicable, there cannot be separate sentences under
the two sections for the same criminal act, and the conviction should properly be under
that section which inflicts the higher punishment.120.
[s 117.1] Instigation is essential.—
A mere intention or preparation to instigate is neither instigation nor abetment. In order
to constitute an offence under this section by pasting leaflets it is necessary that either
the public should have read the leaflets or they should have been exposed to public
gaze.121.
