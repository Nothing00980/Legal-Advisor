COMMENT.—
The offence punishable under this section is the nuisance of causing obstruction, in a
public way or navigable river or canal:
[s 283.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires two things—
1. A person must do an act or omit to take order with any property in his possession or
under his charge.
2. Such act or omission must cause danger, obstruction or injury to any person in any
public way or line of navigation.
It is not necessary to prove that any specific individual was actually obstructed.81.
1. 'Public way'.—Where the privilege of a right of way is enjoyed only by a particular
section of the community or by the inhabitants of two or three villages and not by
others, the way is not a public way within the meaning of this section.82. The section
cannot be extended to a case where a party prohibits strangers from passing through
its fields, even though they may have been allowed access on earlier occasion.83.
[s 283.2] CASES.—
A tractor trolley duly loaded with fertilizers was negligently parked in the middle of the
road by its driver without there being any signal of its being stationary and as such
three persons who were proceeding on a motor-cycle collided with the stationary trolley
and sustained severe injuries. The Rajasthan High Court declined to quash the
proceedings.84.
