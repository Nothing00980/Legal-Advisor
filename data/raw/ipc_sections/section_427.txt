Cheating by personation.
A person is said to "cheat by personation" if he cheats by pretending to be some other
person, or by knowingly substituting one person for another, or representing that he or
any other person is a person other than he or such other person really is.
Explanation.—The offence is committed whether the individual personated is a real or
imaginary person.

COMMENT—
To 'personate' means to pretend to be a particular person.531. As soon as a man by
word, act, or sign holds himself forth as a person entitled to vote with the object of
passing himself off as that person, and exercising the right which that person has, he
has personated him.532. If a person at Oxford, who is not a member of the university,
goes to a shop for the purpose of fraud, wearing a commoner's cap and gown, and
obtains goods, his appearing in a cap and gown is a sufficient false pretence although
nothing passed in words.533.
The person personated may be a real or an imaginary person.
[s 416.1] Ingredients.—
This section requires any one of the following essentials:
(1) Pretention by a person to be some other person.
(2) Knowingly substituting one person for another.
(3) Representation that he or any other person is a person other than he or such
other person really is.
[s 416.2] CASES.—False representation at examination.—
Where A falsely represented himself to be B at a University Examination, got a hall-
ticket under B's name, and wrote papers in B's name, it was held that A was guilty of
cheating by personation and forgery.534.
[s 416.3] False Representation as bachelor.—
It is not correct to say that without delivery of property there cannot be any cheating. A
bare reading of section 415, IPC, 1860, will show that if the person deceived is induced
by reason of deception to do or omit to do anything which he would not do if he were
not so deceived and if the act he has done being so deceived results in some damage
or harm to his body, mind, reputation or property, the offence of cheating would
nevertheless be committed. Thus where the accused dishonestly induced the
complainant and his daughter to go through the marriage ceremony professing himself
to be a bachelor while he had a wife living, it was held that his act amounted to an
offence both under sections 416 and 417, IPC, 1860, as harm was caused to the
complainant and his daughter to their body, mind, reputation and even to their
property.535. In this connection see discussion under head "Explanation" under section
415, ante.
