COMMENT—
This section makes it penal to offer resistance to the taking of property by the lawful
authority of any public servant. The Bombay High Court has held that there are no
words in the section as there are in section 99, extending the operation of the section
to acts which are not strictly justifiable by law. Resistance to an act of a public officer
acting bona fide though in excess of his authority may give rise to some charge in the
nature of assault, but it cannot afford any foundation for a prosecution under this
section.90. The Madras High Court is of opinion that this section should be read in
conjunction with section 99. Taking the two together, if an officer acts in good faith
under colour of his office the mere circumstance that his "act may not be strictly
justifiable by law" cannot affect the lawfulness of his authority. In this case, property
had been seized in execution by the officer of the Court, and it was held that as the
officer was acting bona fide, though he had wrongly seized the property of the accused,
the accused could be convicted under this section for resisting the execution.91. This
view of the law receives substantial support from the decision of the Supreme Court in
Keshoram's case92. where too it has been held that merely because no prior notice was
served on the accused before seizing his cattle under the Delhi Municipal Act for
recovering arrears of milk tax, it could not be said that the municipal officer's action
was entirely illegal and as such the accused had the right of private defence against
the bona fide act of the public servant. In the instant case the accused was held to have
been rightly convicted under sections 353/332/333, IPC, 1860, for assaulting the public
servant. On a parity of reasoning it can be said that had the accused been prosecuted
under section 183 of the Code, he could have also been convicted under that section as
well.
[s 183.1] Lawful authority wanted.—
Where a person resisted an official in attaching property under a warrant, the term of
which had already expired,93. or which did not specify the date on or before which it
was to be executed,94. it was held that he was not guilty under this section. If the
warrant is executed by a Court official when it is addressed to a peon, resistance to the
Court official is not illegal.95.
If a bailiff breaks open the doors of a third person in order to execute a decree against
a judgment-debtor, he is a trespasser if it turns out that the person or goods of the
debtor are not in the house; and under such circumstances the owner of the house
does not by obstructing the bailiff, render himself punishable under section 183 or
section 186.96.
