"Movable property.".
The words "movable property" are intended to include corporeal property 1 of every
description, except land and things attached to the earth 2 or permanently fastened to
anything which is attached to the earth.
COMMENT—
This definition is restricted to corporeal property; it excludes all choices in action. The
definition of "movable property" in the section is not exhaustive.99. The definition of
"movable property" given in the Indian Penal Code is basically meant for the provisions
contained in the Indian Penal Code itself (section 125 Cr PC, 1973).100.
1. 'Corporeal property' is property which may be perceived by the senses, in
contradistinction to incorporeal rights, which are not so perceivable, as obligations of
all kinds. Thus, salt produced on a swamp,101. and papers forming part of the record of
a case,102. are movable property within the meaning of this section. Even if an
assessment order is not 'property' in the hands of the Income-tax Officer, it is 'property'
in the hands of the assessee (section 420 IPC, 1860).103.
2. 'Land and things attached to the earth'.—This section does not exempt "earth and
things attached to the earth", but "land and things attached to the earth"; "land" and
"earth" are not synonymous terms, and there is a great distinction between "the earth",
and "earth". By severance, things that are immovable become movable; and it is
perfectly correct to call those things attached which can be severed; and undoubtedly it
is possible to sever earth from the earth and attach it again thereto. Earth, that is soil,
and all the component parts of the soil, inclusive of stones and minerals, when severed
from the earth or land to which it was attached, are movable property capable of being
the subject of theft.104. Any part of "the earth", whether it is stones or sand or clay or
any other component, when severed from "the earth", is movable property.105. Standing
crop, so long as it is attached to the earth is not movable property as defined in the
Code, but the moment it is severed from the earth its character is changed and it can
become the subject of theft.106.
Fish in any water are corporeal property and they become subject of theft as soon as
they are separated from the waters, dead or alive, and are moved.107.

description" were not supposed to apply for all purposes. The matter before the court was that
of attachment of salary for payment of maintenance.
