The Government Savings Promotion Act, 1873
(5 of 1873)
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The Object of this Bill, which is founded on Statute 26 and 27 Vic. c. 87, Section 30, is to legalize the repayment of moneys deposited in District Savings Banks by or on behalf of Minors, i.e., in the words of the Indian Succession Act, persons who have not completed the age of eighteen years.
Such deposits are often made by fathers on behalf of their minor children and hardship is sometimes caused by the impossibility (as the law stands) of providing thereout for the maintenance, clothing and education of these Minors.
