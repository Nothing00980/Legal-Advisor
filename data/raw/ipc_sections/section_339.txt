Act endangering life or personal safety of others.
Whoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the
personal safety of others, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to two
hundred and fifty rupees, or with both.
COMMENT.â€”
Rash and negligent acts which endanger human life, or the personal safety of others,
are punishable under this section even though no harm follows, and are additionally
punishable under sections 337 and 338 if they cause hurt, or grievous hurt. The word
"rashly" means something more than mere inadvertence or inattentiveness or want of
ordinary care; it implies an indifference to obvious consequences and to the rights of
others.885. An intentional act done with consideration cannot be a rash and negligent
act.886.
Many specific acts of rashness or negligence likely to endanger life or to cause hurt or
injury are made punishable by Chapter XIV.
Section 279 punishes rash driving or riding; section 280, rash navigation of a vessel;
section 284, rash or negligent conduct with respect to poisonous substance; section
285, rash or negligent conduct with respect to any fire or combustible matter; section
286, rash or negligent conduct with respect to any explosive substance; section 287,
negligent conduct with respect to any machinery in the possession of the accused;
section 288, negligence with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings; section 289,
negligence with respect to animals; section 304A, rash or negligent act causing death;
section 336, any rash or negligent act endangering life or personal safety of others;
section 337, rash or negligent act causing hurt; and section 338, rash or negligent act
causing grievous hurt. Like section 304A, sections 279, 336, 337 and 338 IPC, 1860 are
attracted for only the negligent or rash act. The scheme of sections 279, 304A, 336,
337 and 338 leaves no manner of doubt that these offences are punished because of
the inherent danger of the acts specified therein irrespective of knowledge or intention
to produce the result and irrespective of the result. These sections make punishable
the acts themselves which are likely to cause death or injury to human life.
