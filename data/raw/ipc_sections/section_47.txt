"Offence".
Except in the 280.[Chapters] and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of this section,
the word "offence" denotes a thing made punishable by this Code.
In Chapter IV, 281.[Chapter VA] and in the following sections, namely, sections 282.[64,
65, 66, 283.[67], 71], 109, 110, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 284.[118, 119, 120] 187, 194,
195, 203, 211, 213, 214, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 347, 348,
388, 389 and 445, the word "offence" denotes a thing punishable under this Code, or
under any special or local law as hereinafter defined.
And in sections 141, 176, 177, 201, 202, 212, 216 and 441, the word "offence" has the
same meaning when the thing punishable under the special or local law is punishable
under such law with imprisonment for a term of six months or upwards, whether with
or without fine.]
COMMENT—
"Offence" means 'an act or instance of offending'; 'commit an illegal act' and illegal
means, 'contrary to or forbidden by law'. "Offence" has to be read and understood in the
context as it has been prescribed under the provisions of sub-section 40, 41 and 42
IPC, 1860 which cover the offences punishable under IPC, 1860 or under special or
local law or as defined under section 2(n) Cr PC, 1973 or section 3(38) of the General
Clauses Act 1897. There is no statutory offence that takes place when adults willingly
engage in sexual relations outside the marital setting, with the exception of 'adultery' as
defined under section 497 IPC, 1860.285. In Joseph Shine v UOI286. a five judge
Constitution bench of the Supreme Court struck down section 497 of the Indian Penal
Code as manifestly discriminatory and arbitrary. Section 2(n) of Cr PC, 1973 defines
offence as any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force
and includes any act in respect of which a complaint may be under section 20 of the
Cattle Trespass Act 1871 (1 of 1871). Thus, the definition of 'offence' under section
2(n), Cr PC, 1973, is wider enough to enable the police to investigate into offences
under other enactments also, apart from those under the IPC, 1860.287. An offence
seldom consists of a single act. It is usually composed of several elements and, as a
rule; a whole series of acts must be proved before it can be established.288. There is a
basic difference between the offences under the Penal Code and acts and omissions
which have been made punishable under different Acts and statutes which are in
nature of social welfare legislations. For framing charges in respect of those acts and
omissions, in many cases, mens rea is not an essential ingredient; the concerned
statute imposes a duty on those who are in charge of the management, to follow the
statutory provisions and once there is a breach or contravention, such persons become
liable to be punished. But for framing a charge for an offence under the Penal Code, the
traditional rule of existence of mens rea is to be followed.289. In the absence of a
definition in a special act, the term 'offence' should be understood in the context of
section 40 of the Indian Penal Code as an act that is criminally punishable and section
3(38) of the General Clauses Act as an act made punishable by any law and the
essential ingredient is that it should be a criminal act as understood.290. In Naz
Foundation v NCT Delhi.291. section 377 of IPC, 1860 in so far it criminalised
consensual sexual acts of adults in private, was held violative of Article 21, Article 14
and Article 15 of the Constitution by the Delhi High Court.292. This judgement of the
Delhi High Court was later overruled by the Supreme Court on 12 December 2013 in
Suresh Kumar Koushal case.293. Finally in Navtej Singh Johar v UOI,294. a five-judge
bench of the Supreme Court declared section 377 of the Indian Penal Code
unconstitutional, insofar as it criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults of same
sex in private. However, other parts of Section 377 relating to sex with minors and
bestiality remain in force.
[s 40.1] Offences under Special law.—
A plain reading of this provision of law makes it crystal clear that the effect of clause
(2) of section 40 is to make everything punishable under the special law as an offence
within the meaning of the Indian Penal Code. The offences under the NDPS Act thus,
become offences under the Indian Penal Code as the term "offence" in certain cases is
extended to the things made punishable under any special or local law.295.
[s 40.2] Article 20(1).—
The word 'offence' under Article 20 sub-clause (1) of the Constitution has not been
defined under the Constitution. But Article 367 of the Constitution states that unless
the context otherwise requires, the General Clauses Act 1897 shall apply for the
interpretation of the Constitution as it does for the interpretation of an Act.296.
[s 40.3] Offence and breach of duty distinguished.—
Offence generally implies infringement of public, as distinguished from mere private
rights punishable under criminal law. When trial for criminal offence is conducted it
should be in accordance with proof of the offence as per the evidence defined under
the provisions of the Evidence Act. Converse is the case of departmental enquiry. The
enquiry in departmental proceedings relates to conduct or breach of duty of the
delinquent officer to punish him for his misconduct defined under the relevant statutory
rules or law.297.
[s 40.4] Suicide.—
Suicide by itself is not an offence under either English or Indian Criminal Law, though at
one time it was a felony in England.298.
[s 40.5] Euthanasia.—
In India active euthanasia is illegal and a crime under section 302 or at least section
304 IPC, 1860. Physician assisted suicide is a crime under section 306 IPC, 1860
(abetment to suicide).299. But in Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v UOI,300. the Supreme
Court held that passive euthanasia can be allowed under exceptional circumstances
under the strict monitoring of the Court. In March 2018, a five-judge Constitution Bench
of the Supreme Court gave legal sanction to passive euthanasia, permitting 'living will'
by patients.301.
[s 40.6] Sections 40 and 141 IPC, 1860.—
Section 40 specifically mentions as to how the term 'offence' will have to be construed.
In the main clause of the said section it has been clearly set out that the word "offence"
denotes a thing made punishable by this Code except the chapters and sections
mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of the said section. Therefore, going by the main clause
of section 40, the word "offence" since denotes the thing made punishable under the
Code, 'other offence' mentioned in section 141 'third', can only denote to offences,
which are punishable under any of the provisions of the Code. Therefore, by applying
the main clause of section 40, it can be straight away held that all offences referred to
in any of the provisions of the Code for which the punishment is provided for would
automatically fall within the expression "other offence", which has been used in section
141 'third'. Therefore, a conspectus reading of section 40 makes the position
abundantly clear that for all offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the main
clause of section 40 would straight away apply in which event the expression "other
offence" used in section 141 'third', will have to be construed as any offence for which
punishment is prescribed under the Code. To put it differently, whosoever is proceeded
against for any offence punishable under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code,
section 40 sub-clause 1 would straight away apply for the purpose of construing what
the offence is and when it comes to the question of offence under any other special or
local law, the aid of sub-clause 2 and 3 will have to be applied for the purpose of
construing the offence for which the accused is proceeded against. Therefore, having
regard to sub-clause 1 of section 40 of the Code read along with section 141 'third', the
argument of learned senior counsel for the Appellants will have to be rejected. Only
such a construction would be in tune with the purport and intent of the law makers
while defining an unlawful assembly for commission of an offence with a common
object, as specified under section 141 of the Code.302.
