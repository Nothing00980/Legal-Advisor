Whoever kidnaps or abducts any woman1 with intent that she may be compelled, or
knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled, to marry any person against her
will,2 or in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, or knowing it
to be likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine; 1110.[and whoever, by means of criminal intimidation as
defined in this Code or of abuse of authority or any other method of compulsion,
induces any woman to go from any place with intent that she may be, or knowing that
it is likely that she will be, forced or seduced to illicit intercourse with another person
shall be punishable as aforesaid].
COMMENT.—
Where a woman has no intention of marriage or lawful intercourse when kidnapped,
this section applies.
[s 366.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires.—
1. Kidnapping or abducting of any woman.
2. Such kidnapping or abducting must be—
(i) with intent that she may be compelled or knowing it to be likely that she
will be compelled to marry any person against her will; or
(ii) in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, or
knowing it to be likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit
intercourse; or
(iii) by means of criminal intimidation or otherwise by inducing any woman to
go from any place with intent that she may be, or knowing that she will be,
forced or seduced to illicit intercourse.
It is immaterial whether the woman kidnapped is a married woman or not. To
constitute an offence under section 366, IPC, 1860, it is necessary for the prosecution
to prove that the accused induced the complainant-woman or compelled by force to go
from any place, that such inducement was by deceitful means, that such abduction
took place with the intent that the complainant may be seduced to illicit intercourse
and/or that the accused knew it to be likely that the complainant may be seduced to
illicit intercourse as a result of her abduction. Mere abduction does not bring an
accused under the ambit of this penal section. So far as a charge under section 366,
IPC, 1860 is concerned, mere finding that a woman was abducted is not enough, it
must further be proved that the accused abducted the woman with intent that she may
be compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled to marry any person
or in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse or knowing it to be
likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse. Unless the prosecution
proves that the abduction is for the purposes mentioned in section 366, IPC, 1860 the
Court cannot hold the accused guilty and punish him under section 366, IPC, 1860.1111.
1. 'Kidnaps or abducts any woman'.—If the girl was 18 years old or over, she could only
be abducted and not kidnapped, but if she was under eighteen she could be kidnapped
as well as abducted if the taking was by force or the taking or enticing was by deceitful
means.1112. Doubts about age, if not resolved satisfactorily, would go in favour of the
accused.1113.
2. 'With intent that she may be compelled … to marry any person against her will'.—The
intention of the accused is the basis and the gravamen of the offence under this
section. The volition, the intention and the conduct of the woman do not determine the
offence; they can only bear upon the intent with which the accused kidnapped or
abducted the woman, and the intent of the accused is the vital question for
determination in each case. Where only confinement was established, the Supreme
Court held that conviction was possible under sections 365 and 368 and not 366.1114.
Once the necessary intent of the accused is established the offence is complete,
whether or not the accused succeeded in effecting his purpose, and whether or not in
the event the woman consented to the marriage or the illicit intercourse.1115.
In order to establish an offence under section 366 IPC, 1860 it must first be established
that the offence of kidnapping under section 361 IPC, 1860 has been proved. It must
then be shown that such kidnapping was with the contumacious intent referred to
under section 366 IPC, 1860.1116. If the girl kidnapped is below 18 years, consent is
immaterial for the offence to be made out.1117.
3. 'Forced or seduced to illicit intercourse'.—The word 'forced' is used in its ordinary
dictionary sense and includes force by stress of circumstances. The expression
'seduced', used in this section and section 366A, means inducing a woman to submit to
illicit intercourse at any time.1118. The Supreme Court in this case disapproved of the
view taken by the Allahabad and Lahore High Courts that the word 'seduced' used in
this section is properly applicable only to the first act of illicit intercourse unless there
be a proof of return to chastity on the part of the girl. The Calcutta, the Patna, the
Madras and the Bombay High Courts had held that 'seduction' is not used in the narrow
sense of inducing a girl to part with her virtue for the first time, but includes subsequent
seduction for further acts of illicit intercourse.1119. Mere abduction does not make out
an offence under section 366, IPC, 1860. It must further be proved that the accused
abducted the woman for any of the purposes mentioned in section 366.1120.
[s 366.2] Consent.—
Merely because a person did not give passive resistance it does not mean his helpless
resignation on face of inevitable compulsion cannot be deemed as consent. Only
conclusion relevant is that she was kidnapped and kept under barrier and was raped
against her will.1121. Where the evidence showed that victim herself had called the
accused to meet her at a place outside the village, it was held that accused was
entitled to acquittal.1122. Prosecutrix aged 19 years accompanied her elder sister went
with appellant voluntarily and did not make any annoyance and performed intercourse
with him. Only after tracing her out by Police, in connection with report of missing
person, she stated to Police some ingredients of offence of rape. It is apparent that in
spite of having opportunity at various stages and various places, she did not complain
to any one or did not make any annoyance saying that she is being taken by appellant
without her will. Offence was not made out.1123. Where the girl supposed to have been
taken away under threats was taken from one place to another and they stayed at
different hotels, the girl making no protest anywhere, her consent was presumed.1124.
Where the prosecutrix, a teenaged girl, did not put up struggle or jump down from the
cycle of the accused or not even raised an alarm while being taken away, the offence
under section 366 was not made out. The conviction was set aside.1125.
Mere submission without resistance cannot tantamount to consent.1126.
[s 366.3] Tribal custom of forced marriage.—
The existence of a tribal custom under which a girl can be forced to marry her abductor
or kidnapper by taking her away and subjecting her to intercourse cannot be accepted
as a good defence, it being contrary to law. But a lenient sentence of only six months
was imposed in view of the application for compounding submitted by the victim girl
and her father. The token punishment was necessary because the offence was not
compoundable.1127.
[s 366.4] Section 366 is not a minor offence of section 376.—
It is true that section 222 of the Cr PC, 1973 entitles a Court to convict a person of an
offence which is minor in comparison to the one for which he is being tried but section
366 of the IPC, 1860 cannot be said to be a minor offence in relation to an offence
under section 376 of the IPC, 1860 as both the offences are of distinct and different
categories having different ingredients.1128.
[s 366.5] Punishment.—
In State of MP v Rameshwar,1129. where the victim was approximately 16 years of age
and was seduced and kidnapped by the respondent by promising to marry her. The
Supreme Court, restored the sentence awarded by the trial Court, but reduced it to one
year.1130.
[s 366.6] When sentence shall run consecutively.—
In Muthuramalingam v State,1131. the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court
examined the various issues relating to the sentencing of the accused, where multiple
murders were committed by them, and held that while multiple sentences for
imprisonment for life can be awarded for multiple murders or other offences
punishable with imprisonment for life, the life sentences so awarded cannot be
directed to run consecutively. Such sentences would, however, be super imposed over
each other, so that any remission or commutation granted by a competent authority in
one does not ipso facto result in remission of the sentence awarded to the prisoner for
the other.
