Punishment for cheating by personation.
Whoever cheats by personation shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT—
If a person cheats by pretending to be some other person, or representing that he is a
person other than he, then, such person can be charged with the allegation of 'cheating
by personation' (section 416, IPC, 1860) and punished under section. 419, IPC, 1860.
[s 419.1] Overlapping.—
The offences under sections 170, IPC, 1860 and 419, IPC, 1860 overlap each other.
Cheating by personation (section 419, IPC, 1860) is an offence of general character,
under which a person may pretend to be anyone, other than what he really is. But,
cheating by pretending to be a public servant (section 170, IPC, 1860) is a specific
offence, where one pretends to be a public servant and has all the ingredients of
cheating by personation under section 419, IPC, 1860.548.
