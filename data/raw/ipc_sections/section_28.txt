Gaining wrongfully, Losing wrongfully
A person is said to gain wrongfully when such person retains wrongfully, as well
as when such person acquires wrongfully. A person is said to lose wrongfully
when such person is wrongfully kept out of any property,1 as well as when such
person is wrongfully deprived of property.
COMMENT—
The word 'wrongful' means prejudicially affecting a party in some legal right. For either
wrongful loss or gain, the property must be lost to the owner, or the owner must be
wrongfully kept out of it. Thus, where a pledgee used a turban that was pledged, it was
held that the deterioration of the turban by use was not 'wrongful loss' of property to
the owner, and the wrongful beneficial use of it by the pledgee was not a 'wrongful gain'
to him.108. The gain or loss contemplated need not be a total acquisition or a total
deprivation but it is enough if it is a temporary retention of property by the person
wrongfully gaining or a temporary "keeping out" of property from the person legally
entitled.109. Forcible and illegal seizure of bullocks of a widow in satisfaction of a debt
due to the accused by her deceased husband was held to be a 'wrongful loss'.110.
Where a person, who purchased rice from a famine relief officer, at a certain rate on
condition that he should sell it at a pound the rupee less, did not sell it at the rate
agreed upon, but at four pounds the rupee less, it was held that no wrongful gain or
wrongful loss had been caused to anyone within the meaning of this section. The rice
having been sold to the accused, and he having paid for it, it was not unlawful for him
to sell it again at such price as he thought fit.111. Where the accused removed jute kept
in a pond of the complainant for wetting and requested the complainant to take it away
as the accused bona fide claimed the ownership of the pond, it was held that no
wrongful loss was caused to the complainant.112.
The words "gaining wrongfully," or "losing wrongfully" would cover cases of wrongful
detention of property in the one case and wrongfully being kept out of property in the
other.113.
1. 'Wrongfully kept out of any property'.—When the owner is kept out of possession of
his property with the object of depriving him of the benefit arising from the possession
even temporarily, the case will come within the definition. If a creditor by force or
otherwise takes the goods of his debtor out of his possession against his will in order
to put pressure on him to compel him to discharge his debt he will be guilty of theft by
causing wrongful loss to the debtor.114. The loss must be caused wrongfully. Thus,
whose municipal officers demolished an unauthorised construction as the complainant
refused to remove the structure in spite of notice, they could not be held guilty of
committing an offence of mischief within the meaning of section 425, IPC, 1860, for
there was no intention to cause wrongful loss to the complainant as the demolition
was done lawfully in exercise of powers under sections 179 and 189 of the
Maharashtra Municipalities Act.115.
Fees payable to a college for attending lectures are "property" within the meaning of
this section.116.
