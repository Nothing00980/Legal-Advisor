When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.
The right of private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in
the last preceding section, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to
the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of any of the
descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:—
First.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will
otherwise be the consequence of such assault;
Secondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous
hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault;
Thirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape;
Fourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust;
Fifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting;
Sixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under
circumstances which may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable
to have recourse to the public authorities for his release.
449.[Seventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or
administer acid which may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will
otherwise be the consequence of such act.]
COMMENT.—
The law authorizes a man who is under a reasonable apprehension that his life is in
danger or his body in risk of grievous hurt to inflict death upon his assailant either
when the assault is attempted or directly threatened, but the apprehension must be
reasonable and the violence inflicted must not be greater than is reasonably necessary
for the purpose of self-defence. It must be proportionate to and commensurate with
the quality and character of the act it is intended to meet and what is done in excess is
not protected. Where the accused was attacked by three persons and sustained an
injury on the forehead, a vital part, he had reasonable apprehension of some hurt to be
caused to him and had the right of self-defence but had exceeded by causing more
harm to his assailants than needed. He was liable under section 304, Part I, and not
under section 302.450. Where after receiving nine injuries, two on vital parts, the
accused fired one shot from his gun which hit fatally an innocent person, the right of
private defence extending to cause death was still available to the accused. His
conviction under section 304, Part I was set aside.451. Where the complainant's party
had deliberately gathered near the house of the accused and scolded them and caused
injuries to his father, the accused was held justified in exercising the right of private
defence to defend his father and his conviction under section 300 was set aside.452. It
is the reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt that gives rise to the right of
private defence under clauses (1) and (2) of section 100, IPC, 1860., and it has got
nothing to do with the actual injury that the person exercising the right of private
defence has suffered, which may or may not be grievous.453. Where the accused fails
to make out a case of reasonable apprehension, he cannot claim the right of private
defence.454. Where the life of the accused was not endangered by the ladies armed
with broom sticks and 'chappals', the accused was not entitled to stab one of the ladies
to death in exercise of right of private defence.455.
The extended right of private defence to the extent of causing death of the assailant
arises only if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right is of one of the
kinds mentioned in this section.456. Following some earlier rulings, the Supreme Court
has re-emphasised that the mere fact of the accused sustaining some injuries in the
course of the same transaction does not make it out conclusively that the accused had
the occasion to cause death in private defence.457. Where the attacking party chanced
to get at the wife of the accused and the latter pounced upon them with a weapon
attacking one of them which was warded off, another came forward and the accused
successfully struck him and he died, the accused was held to be within his rights.458.
As against this where two were fighting with lathis and the brother of one of them, who
was outside the danger, struck a lathi blow to the other killing him, he was held to be
guilty under section 304-I.459. In a communal tension, both sides pelted stones. The
accused fired a gun shot causing death of a person of the other group though no one
had sustained any injury as a result of pelting of stones by the other group. It was held
that the accused had no occasion to act under the right of private defence.460.
In order to justify the act of causing death of assailant, the accused has simply to
satisfy the Court that there was reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt.
Question whether the apprehension was reasonable or not is a question of fact
depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case and no straitjacket formula
can be prescribed in this regard. Weapon used, the manner and nature of assault and
other surrounding circumstances should be taken into account while evaluating
whether the apprehension was justified or not. In the instant case, accused G was
assaulted on head by a sharp-edged weapon which caused a bone-deep injury. As per
the defence version there were four assailants who had come well prepared at the door
of accused's house to commit assault. Reasonable apprehension of death or at least of
grievous hurt, therefore, could not be ruled out. In such a situation, if single gunshot
was fired it could not be said that the accused persons had exceeded their right of
private defence in any manner.461.
[s 100.1] 'Abducting'.—
On a plain reading of clause fifth of this section, there does not seem to be any reason
for holding that the word 'abducting' used in the clause means anything more than
what is defined as "abduction" in section 362. All that the clause requires is that there
should be an assault which is an offence against the human body and that assault
should be with the intention of abducting, and whenever these elements are present the
clause will be applicable.462. Thus, a woman could not be taken away by force even by
her own husband from a paramour's house and if in these circumstances the paramour
and his brother killed the husband to prevent her abduction by the husband, they would
be protected by sub-clause (5) of section 100 of the Penal Code.463. Here law seems to
be contrary to our social conscience, but this interpretation is perfectly in accord with
the language of section 100, IPC, 1860, and the decision of the Supreme Court in
Viswanath's case464. where too the husband was put to death by a clean stab by his
brother-in-law as he was trying to take away his wife by force from his father-in-law's
house and in the process had merely dragged his unwilling wife to some distance.
[s 100.2] Rescuing woman-folk from attack on modesty.—
The accused heard the cries for help of his widowed sister-in-law. He ran to her house
with gandasa. He found the attacker grappling with her and trying to outrage her
modesty. The accused saved her from his clutches and inflicted a gandasa blow while
he was going to run away. The act of the accused was held to have been done in the
exercise of the right of private defence. The accused was acquitted.465.
[s 100.3] CASES.—Exceeding the right.—
The accused was being chased. He assaulted the chaser. The latter died. The injuries
found on the person of the deceased were more grievous than those on the body of the
accused. It was held that the accused exceeded his right of private defence his
conviction was altered from under section 300 to one under section 304, Part I.466.
Whenever accused-party sustains injuries in the same occurrence and when the
injuries are grievous in nature it is incumbent upon the prosecution to explain the
injuries on the person of the accused.467. Where the accused might have acted on self-
defence in the beginning, but once the deceased was. The prosecution party consisted
of four members. They carried blunt weapons. They assembled in front of the house of
the accused. They came as aggressors. The accused suffered a bone deep injury on
his head. The accused fired a single gunshot which caused death of one of the
members on the prosecution side. The Court held that the right of private defence was
not exceeded. The accused was given the benefit of doubt.468.
Where the victim was throwing broken bricks at the accused who received simple
injuries and the accused fired at him with his gun, it was held that he exceeded the right
of private defence. There was no justification for using the gun in such as to cause
death. Conviction under section 304 Part I was restored.469. The right of private
defence was not allowed to be claimed merely on the ground that there was a quarrel
and the accused sustained injuries in the course of it.470.
[s 100.4] No danger.—
Two friends were sitting together and consuming liquor. They quarrelled and
exchanged blows. One of them inflicted two knife wounds on vital parts of the body of
the other. The victim had posed no danger to the attacker, nor did he have any weapons
with him. The plea of self-defence was held to be not available. The accused was
convicted for murder.471. The deceased came to his land and asked the accused party
to get the land measured and also tried to dislodge a pole fixed by them. There was no
imminent danger to person on property from any act of the deceased. No injuries
caused to anybody. It was held that there was no right of self-defence in the exercise of
which the deceased could have been killed.472.
[s 100.5] Private defence.—
The accused was without any arms when the quarrel started. His action of picking up a
stick lying on the ground and hitting the deceased on his head with it showed that he
was trying to save himself from the attack by the deceased and his son. The accused
was acquitted because the circumstances made it obvious that he was acting in self-
defence.473.
[s 100.6] Burden of proof.—
The right of private defence is a plea which is available to the accused by the burden of
proving the same is on him.474. Proof by preponderance of probabilities is
sufficient.475. The burden of proving the right of private defence is not as onerous as
that of the prosecution to prove its case. Preponderance of probabilities in favour of
the defence is enough to discharge the burden.476. While the prosecution is required to
prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the accused need not establish his plea of
self-defence to the hilt and may discharge onus by showing preponderance of
probabilities in favour of that plea on basis of material on record, injuries received by an
accused, imminence of threat to his safety, injuries caused by accused and
circumstances whether accused had time to have recourse to public authorities were
held to relevant factors. But number of injuries is not always considered to be a safe
criterion for determining who the aggressor was. Whenever injuries are on the body of
the accused person, presumption need not necessarily be raised that accused person
had caused injuries in his defence. Defence has to further to show that injuries so
caused on accused probabilise version of private defence. Non-explanation of injuries
sustained by the accused at about the time of occurrence or in course of the
altercation is a very important circumstance but mere non-explanation may not affect
prosecution case in all cases.477.
The burden stands discharged by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of
the plea of the accused either by himself adducing positive evidence or by referring to
circumstances transpiring from prosecution evidence itself. Proof beyond reasonable
doubt is not required. The Court can consider the plea even if not taken by the accused
if the material on record makes it available for consideration.478.
[s 100.7] Acid Attack (Clause 7).—
The right of private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in
section 99, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant if the
offence which occasions the exercise of the right against an act of throwing or
administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid which may reasonably
cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such
act. This new category of offence (acid attacks) to which a right to private defence is
inserted by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013479. on the recommendation of
Justice Verma Committee.
