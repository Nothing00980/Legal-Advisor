COMMENTâ€”
This section is intended to put down with a heavy hand any preparation to wage war
against the Government of India. The act made punishable by this section cannot be
considered attempts; they are in truth preparations made for committing the offence of
waging war. Preparation consists of devising or arranging the means or measures
necessary for the commission of the offence. It differs widely from attempt which is
the direct movement towards the commission after preparations are made. Preparation
to commit an offence is punishable only when the preparation is to commit offences
under section 122 (waging war against the Government of India) and section 399
(preparation and an attempt is sometimes thin and has to be decided on the facts of
each case). There is a greater degree of determination in attempt as compared with
preparation.45.
