Negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance.
Whoever does, with any explosive substance, any act so rashly or negligently as to
endanger human life, or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person,
or knowingly or negligently omits to take such order with any explosive substance in
his possession as is sufficient to guard against any probable danger to human life
from that substance,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with
both.
COMMENT.—
The foregoing section deals with 'fire or combustible matter', this with 'explosive
substance'; otherwise, the provisions of both the sections are alike.
The word 'knowingly' is evidently used in this section advisedly.
[s 286.1] Limitation.—
In a case, the occurrence took place as far back as in the year 1995 and the challan
was presented in the year 2006. The prosecution was launched against the petitioners
beyond the period of limitation as prescribed under the statute. Proceedings under
sections 286 and 9-B and 9-C of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, were quashed.89.
