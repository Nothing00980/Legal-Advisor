Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different
from that intended by the abettor.
When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a
particular effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the
abetment, caused a different effect from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is
liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had
abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the act
abetted was likely to cause that effect.
ILLUSTRATION
A instigates B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of the instigation causes
grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt
abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment
provided for murder.
COMMENTS.â€”
This section should be read in conjunction with section 111. Section 111 provides for
the doing of an act different from the one abetted, whereas this section deals with the
case when the act done is the same as the act abetted but its effect is different.
