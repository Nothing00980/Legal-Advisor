Punishment for lurking house-trespass or house-breaking.
Whoever commits lurking house-trespass or house-breaking, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENTâ€”
This section provides penalty for the offences defined in sections 443 and 444.
In all "house-breaking" there must be "house-trespass", and in all "house-trespass" there
must be "criminal trespass". Unless, therefore, the intent necessary to prove "criminal
trespass" is present, the offence of house-breaking or house-trespass cannot be
committed. Where accused simply unlatched the chain and entered house of
complainant in the night and there was nothing to show that any device such as metal
rod, crow bar or even a stick was used by accused. It was held that preparation for
commission of offence not proved. It is also held that house trespass without
preparation is covered under section 453 IPC, 1860, not under section 452 IPC,
1860.715.
