Inland Vessels Act, 1917
1.
 of 1917
1124.
 


Objects and Reasons.- Amending Act 35 of 1977.- With the passage of time, operation of power vessels in the inland waters of the  country has undergone considerable change with the result that the provisions contained in the Indian Steam-vessels  Act, 1917, are not found to be adequate effectively to regulate the operation of the inland vessels. A committee was set  up by the Government of India under the Chairmanship of Shri B. Bhagavati, Member of Parliament to consider the  problems relating to the development of inland water transport and to suggest phased programme for development of  this mode of transport. Recommendations for the amendment of the Act were made by the Committee. Certain other  legislative changes are also considered necessary in the light of practical experience. The amendment proposed in the  Bill are intended to make the legislation more effective and useful in regulating the operation of inland vessels having  regard to the present day needs.
2. The principal Act was enacted when steam-vessels were in vogue. With the advent of oil-fired vessels,  steam-vessels have become scare and even the short title to the Act would be misleading in the present context.  Accordingly it is proposed to modify the short title of the Act as "Inland Vessels Act" and to substitute the expression  "steam-vessel" by the expression "mechanically propelled vessel". There is no provision now enabling the mortgage of  vessels by owners for securing financial assistance for the construction or repair of vessels. Provisions in that regard on  the lines of those contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (
44 of 1958
) are proposed in order to overcome the  difficulty. In the case of wreck, etc., the State Government is authorised to appoint a Court of investigation only on a  report to that effect from the master of the vessei. It is considered necessary to provide for the appointment of a Court  of investigation on the report of persons other than the master also. At present there is no provision in the Act enabling  the State Government to take action to clear navigable channels blocked by werck or other obstruction or by the  grounding of an overdrafted vessel though such provisions do find a place in the Indian Ports Act, 1908 (15 of 1908). It  is proposed to empower the State Government to clear up the navigable channels so blocked or obstructed.  Compensation to passengers travelling in inland vessels involved in accidents is a public necessity. It is, therefore,  proposed to provide for the obligatory insurance of passengers against risk and the burden is cast on licensed carriers  by adopting provisions analogous to those applicable in the case of motor vehicles accidents. In view of the danger  involved in carrying passengers or cargo or bottkin excess of what is set forth in the certificate of survey granted to a  vessel, it is considered necessary to enhance the penalty for exceeding the set limits. In case of desertion, wilful absence  from duty, negligence, etc. by personnel employed in inland mechanically propelled vessels there are no provisions for  the taking of disciplinary proceedings. Provisions analogous to those in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 are proposed  to be included so as to ensure discipline among the personnel. Opportunity is also being taken to amend the rule laying  formula to bring it in conformity with the recommendation of the Committee on Subordinate Legislation.
