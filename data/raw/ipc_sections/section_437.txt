Punishment for mischief.
Whoever commits mischief shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT—
Ingredients.—This section requires three things:—
(1) intention or knowledge of likelihood to cause wrongful loss or damage to the
public or to any person;
(2) causing the destruction of some property or any change in it or in its situation;
and
(3) such change must destroy or diminish its value or utility, or affect it injuriously.
This section deals with a physical injury from a physical cause.607. Section 426, IPC,
1860 deals with punishment for the offence of "mischief" as defined in section 425.
The said section 425 enacts a rule of which the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non
laedasis but a partial exponent. It enacts a rule which, while preserving to the owner the
maximum rights of property, prevents his using it to the injury or damage of another
and all fortiori it punishes all who wantonly cause such injury or damage to another's
property. Neither malice nor an intention to cause injury is essential for the constitution
of the offence which may be committed by injury caused with only the knowledge of
likelihood, which must, however, he strictly proved. The first part of the section sets out
the mens rea on the guilty mind, which is the intention or the knowledge of likelihood of
causing wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person. The second part of the
section pertains to the actus res, that is to say, the criminal act, which consists in
causing destruction to any property or any such change in any property or in the
situation thereof as destroys or diminishes its value or utility or affects it injuriously.
The express mention of "damage" in the section is indicative of the fact that the
purview of the offence of "mischief" is not intended to be confined only to cases of
"wrongful loss", but also to engulf within it all such cases of damages by unlawful
means. Destruction of any property within the meaning of the section carries with it the
implication that something should be done to the property contrary to its natural use
and serviceableness. Mischief implies the causing of wrongful loss or damage and no
loss or damage is wrongful unless it involves invasion of a legal right. In any other case
it is damnum sine injuria.608.
Acts done or attempted to be done in bona fide assertion of a right, however ill-founded
in law that right may be, cannot amount to the offence of mischief within section
425.609. Thus, where the accused pulled down a wall which obstructed his pathway to
his kotha and which pathway he had been using for the last 22 years, it was held no
offence under section 425, IPC, 1860, was committed.610.
1. 'Intend to cause, or knowing that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to
the public or to any person'.—This section does not necessarily contemplate damage
of a destructive character. It requires merely that there should be an invasion of right
and diminution of the value of one's property, caused by that invasion of right, which
must have been contemplated by the doer of it when he did it.611. A dominant owner,
having a right of way over land belonging to another, has no right himself to remove an
obstruction unless his right of way is impaired by it. If he does so, he has employed
unlawful means and if loss of property is caused thereby to another, he is guilty under
this section.612. It is no answer to a charge of mischief to plead that the motive of the
accused was to benefit himself, and not to injure another, if he knew that he could only
secure that benefit by causing wrongful loss to another.613. Where while taking
possession of the allotted portion of a house on the basis of a valid allotment order, the
goods were simply put outside the premises and no obstruction was caused to the
complainant landlord to collect his goods, offences under sections 425 and 427 were
not made out.614.
2. 'Causes the destruction of any property or any such change in any property, etc.'.—It
is the essence of this offence that the perpetrator must cause the destruction of
property or such change in it as destroys or diminishes its value or utility. The
destruction of a document evidencing an agreement void for immorality constitutes
this offence as it can be used as evidence for other collateral purposes.615. The
accused on receiving delivery of a registered article from a Postmaster was requested
to sign an acknowledgement for the article received by him, but instead of returning the
same duly signed he tore it up and threw it on the ground. It was held that he was guilty
of mischief.616.
The 'destruction' or 'change' should be contrary to the natural use and serviceableness
of the property in question. If a person unauthorisedly allows goats to graze in a forest,
the grazing rights in which are restricted to holders of permits, the offence of mischief
is not committed as by such an act the grass is only put to its normal use.617. The
accused had a dispute about the possession of a certain land with the complainant.
The complainant dug a well with a view to cultivate the said land, but the accused
forcibly entered on the land and damaged the well. It was held that accused were guilty
of mischief even though the complainant was a trespasser.618. Merely disconnecting
electric supply does not amount to destruction of property or to such a change in
property as destroys or diminishes its utility or value, and does not constitute an
offence of mischief.619. A contrary view to this view of the Calcutta High Court has
been taken by the Delhi High Court to say that switching off the electric supply by the
landlord to the tenanted premises, even without causing damage to the distribution
board or wires supplying electric current diminishes the value and utility of the tenanted
premises within the meaning of section 425, IPC, 1860.620. In order to make out an
offence of mischief it is necessary to show that there was wrongful loss or damage to
the property. So unless the property was destroyed or underwent such a change due to
the action of the accused that its utility or value was diminished, no offence under
section 425, IPC, 1860, could be said to have been committed. Thus where a family
took shelter in the door-way of an uninhabitable and dilapidated house by throwing
away a few articles, the offence of mischief was not committed.621. Cutting off the
water supply constitutes such destructive change in the flat as diminishes its value or
utility.622.
[s 426.1] 'Property'
means some tangible property capable of being forcibly destroyed but does not include
an easement. The section refers to corporeal property and provides for cases in which
such property is either destroyed or altered or otherwise damaged with a particular
intent. A right to collect tolls at a public ferry is not property within the meaning of this
section.623. Where a person owns land on which there is a drain, the water running
through which is used as of right by way of easement by another person, the former is
not guilty of mischief, if the drain is destroyed by him because an easement does not
come within the purview of 'property' within the meaning of section 425.624. The
offence of mischief may be committed in respect of both movable and immovable
property.625.
[s 426.2] 'Change'
means a physical change in composition or form. The section contemplates a physical
injury from a physical cause. Making a breach in the wall of a canal is an act which
causes such a change in the property as destroys or diminishes its value or affects it
injuriously.626.
Where a landlord, in breach of an agreement with his tenants, omitted to pump water
into their flats from a central reservoir without, however, interfering in any way with their
taking water from the central reservoir, such omission did not constitute such a change
as would make it "mischief" within the meaning of this section.627. There is a contrary
view to this which holds that cutting off the water supply does constitute an offence of
mischief.628. So also would be the case in regard to cutting off the supply of electricity
by the landlord to the tenanted portion of the house.629. This latter view appears to be
more reasonable.
3. 'As destroys or diminishes its value or utility, etc.'.—Destruction or diminution in
value of the property regarding which the offence is committed is essential. The utility
referred to in this section is that conceived by the owner and not by the accused.630.
[s 426.3] Explanation 1.—
Illustrations (e) and (f) exemplify this Explanation. It is not essential that the property
interfered with should belong to the person injuriously affected. D, as a lessee of
Government, held rights of fishery in a particular stretch of a river. C, by diverting the
water of that river, converted the bed of the river for a considerable distance into dry
land, or land with a very shallow covering of water upon it, and by so doing he was
enabled to destroy, and did destroy, very large quantities of fish, both mature and
immature. It was held that when C deliberately changed the course and condition of the
river in the manner described to the detriment of D. he was guilty of mischief.631.
[s 426.4] Explanation 2.—
A person who destroys property, which, at the time, belongs to himself, with the
intention of causing, or knowing that it is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to
anybody else is guilty of this offence.632. Illustrations (b) and (g) show that a man may
commit mischief on his own property. In order, however, to his doing so, it is necessary
that he intends to cause wrongful loss to some person, as in the cases stated in the
illustrations.

accompanied with intention to cause wrongful loss or damage may amount to mischief.
