Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt.
Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt, shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
one year, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This is a general section for the punishment of voluntarily causing hurt. Sections 324,
327, 328, 329 and 330 deal with the same offence committed under certain
aggravating circumstances: and sections 334, 336 and 337 provide for punishment
when there are certain mitigating circumstances.
A prosecution under this section does not abate by reason of the death of the person
injured.741.
[s 323.1] CASES.—
Allegation that accused/superintendent of police arrested the younger brother of
complainant and got him mercilessly beaten by his personal guards. Injuries on
different parts of body clearly rules out the theory of sustaining it while falling down on
ground. Besides the testimony of injured, the prosecution case has further been
corroborated by medical evidence. Record and evidence proved that conspiracy was
hatched by accused to apprehend the detenu and others who were demanding his
transfer. Accused liable to be convicted under section 323 of IPC, 1860.742. First
accused picked up a wooden piece (Pacher) with both the hands and hit on the head of
the deceased. On receiving injury, he fell unconscious on the spot. Thereafter, the other
accused came running and dealt a blow on the head of PW3. Conviction of first
accused under section 304 Part II and co-accused under section 323 IPC, 1860 was
held proper.743. Where accused having sticks in their hands entered the house of
complainant and assaulted him, the overt act attributed to accused by witnesses is
specific, medical evidence fully supports the case of prosecution and
accused/respondent is liable to be convicted under section 323 of IPC, 1860.744. The
accused, a shopkeeper, in a sudden quarrel hit his wife on the head with an iron weight
of 200 grams which resulted in her death. The medical evidence showed that the injury
was of a simple nature and there was no evidence that the deceased died of shock
caused by the injury. He was held liable only under section 323 IPC, 1860 and not under
section 304 IPC, 1860.745. So also where the wife attacked the husband with a brick
causing multiple injuries resulting in his death but according to medical evidence the
injuries were of a simple nature and were not sufficient in ordinary course of nature to
cause death, it was held that the accused wife could not be convicted under section
302 IPC, 1860. Her conviction was accordingly changed to one under section 323 IPC,
1860.746.
The accused pushed the victim. She fell down and sustained injuries of simple nature.
This act of the accused was held to fall under section 323.747. Where the accused gave
a push on the chest of the deceased and the victim fell on a stone resulting in death,
conviction was recorded under section 323.748. The accused husband returned home
at midnight in a drunken state. He beat his wife and threw a piece of stone on her head
and she died. The post-mortem report revealed three simple injuries on her head and
exact cause of death could not be ascertained. Relations between the accused and the
deceased were found to be cordial. Intention to cause the victim's death was not
proved. Conviction of the accused under section 300 was set aside and he was
convicted under section 323.749. Several persons attacked and caused the death of
their victim. All, including the present appellant, were holding the deceased and one of
them K dealt fatal blows. K was convicted of murder under section 302. All his fellows
were convicted under this section read with section 149 except the present appellant
who was convicted under section 302 read with section 34. The Supreme Court held
that the appellant should also have been convicted under this section read with section
149.750. Thomas v State of Kerala,751. the fist blow caused by the accused resulted in
subdural haematoma which led to the death of the victim, but it could not be said that
the accused could be attributed with the knowledge that by such act he was likely to
cause death, nor could it be said that the accused intended to cause that particular
injury which he actually caused, it was held that accused could be convicted only under
section 323 and not section 300. In Mohan Singh v State of Rajasthan,752. the accused
attacked his victim and caused voluntary hurt to him by inflicting fist blows and
causing nose injury. His guilt was established by the evidence of the witnesses. The
plea of alibi raised by the accused was not tenable. His conviction under section 323
was upheld.
Where the offence was punishable under this section and also under sections 304, Part
II/34, and was covered by the Uttar Pradesh Children Act, 1951, the Court did not
consider it proper to subject children to imprisonment but, looking at the brutal nature
of the offence, imposed a sentence of fine.753.
Where the accused brothers chanced to converge, having not met before, at their
sister's place avowedly to teach her a lesson for having instituted proceedings against
them and one of them who, not known to others was carrying a knife, inflicted a knife
blow which, landing on a vital part, caused death, they were convicted under this
section and the knife wielding brother under section 304 Part-II.754. In a case of
attempt to murder, one of the accused gave only one blow with a 'lathi' on the shoulder
of the injured without sharing the common intention of the other accused. Injury was
simple and caused only swelling. He was convicted for his individual act under section
323 and was released on probation.755.
[s 323.2] Conviction altered to 323.—
Where the Doctor had clearly established that the injuries sustained by the deceased
were all simple in nature inflicted upon non-vital parts of the body. The injuries in
question were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The High
Court justified in allowing the appeal of the respondents in part and acquitting them of
the charge of murder while maintaining their conviction for the remaining offences with
which they were charged.756.
Where in a quarrel the accused kicked the deceased on his testicles but as no medical
treatment was given for two days, the injured died due to Toxaemia caused by
gangrene. The injury to the testicles was not the direct cause of his death. The
Supreme Court set aside his conviction under section 304 Part II and convicted him
under section 323 instead.757. In a dispute over land the defence of accused regarding
exercising of private defence was not accepted. Sentence of accused under section
304, Part II was maintained. Other accused were convicted under section 323 IPC,
1860.758.
The accused, a police constable, beat up a frail old man of 60 years weighing only 38
Kg. His ribs were broken and that resulted in his death. The Court said that the accused
must have intended the consequences of his act. His conviction was altered from
under section 323 to section 304, Part II. The incident had become 15 years old. He
had already served some portion of his punishment. He was allowed to surrender to
serve the remaining portion.759.
[s 323.3] Acquittal.—
Allegation that accused/respondents gave beatings to complainant and one of them
caused incised wound on her right forearm with sickle. Prosecution did not explain as
to how the respondents had sustained injuries in said incident. Acquittal of
respondents was held proper.760. Where there is no corroborative evidence that injuries
found on person of informant was caused none other than by the appellant, the offence
under section 323 of IPC, 1860 could not be proved beyond doubt. Conviction recorded
against appellant was held improper and liable to be set aside.761.
[s 323.4] Punishment.—
Where there was no pre-planned intention to cause death and the incident was the
result of a heated moment caused by exchange of abuses, the sentence of six months
RI was modified to the period already undergone.762. In an incident of hurt and
kidnapping, both the accused persons were married and had children. Their previous
conduct was not bad. The victim girl was not physically harmed and become married
subsequently. Sentence of six years RI under section 366 for kidnapping was reduced
to two years but the sentence of six months under section 323 was not reduced.763.
[s 323.5] Probation.—
In view of the fact that incident occurred on spur of moment and was traverse in nature
and accused did not have any previous conviction, accused was allowed to release on
probation.764.
