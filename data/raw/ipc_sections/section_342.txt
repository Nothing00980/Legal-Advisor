Wrongful restraint.
Whoever voluntarily obstructs any person so as to prevent that person from
proceeding in any direction in which that person has a right to proceed, is said
wrongfully to restrain that person.
Exception.—The obstruction of a private way over land or water which a person in
good faith believes himself to have a lawful right to obstruct, is not an offence within
the meaning of this section.
ILLUSTRATION
A obstructs a path along which Z has a right to pass. A not believing in good faith that
he has a right to stop the path. Z is thereby prevented from passing. A wrongfully
restrains Z.
COMMENT.—
Wrongful restraint means the keeping a man out of a place where he wishes to be, and
has a right to be.907. The slightest unlawful obstruction to the liberty of the subject to
go, when and where he likes to go, provided he does so in a lawful manner, cannot be
justified, and is punishable under this section.908.
[s 339.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires—
(1) Voluntary obstruction of a person.
(2) The obstruction must be such as to prevent that person from proceeding in any
direction in which he has a right to proceed. The word 'voluntary' is significant. It
connotes that obstruction should be direct. The obstructions must be a
restriction on the normal movement of a person. It should be a physical one.
They should have common intention to cause obstruction.909.
The following illustrations, given in the original Draft Code,910. further elucidate the
meaning of this section:—
(a) A builds a wall across a path along which Z has a right to pass. Z is thereby
prevented from passing. A wrongfully restrains Z.
(b) A illegally omits to take proper order with a furious buffalo which is in his
possession and thus voluntarily deters Z from passing along a road along which
Z has a right to pass. A wrongfully restrains Z.
(c) A threatens to set a savage dog at Z, if Z goes along a path along which Z has a
right to go. Z is thus prevented from going along that path. A wrongfully
restrains Z.
(d) In the last illustration, if the dog is not really savage, but if A voluntarily causes Z
to think that it is savage, and thereby prevents Z from going along the path, A
wrongfully restrains Z.
From these illustrations it will appear that a person may obstruct another by causing it
to appear to that other that it is impossible, difficult or dangerous to proceed, as well as
by causing it actually to be impossible, difficult or dangerous for that other to proceed.
For the offence of wrongful restraint, the necessary pre-condition is that the person
concerned must have a right to proceed.911. It is an inevitable factor under section 339
of the IPC, 1860 which defines wrongful restraint that the person, who is obstructed,
has the right to proceed in a particular direction. If section 339 and section 31 are read
together, it will be clear that if the accused voluntarily obstructs any person so as to
prevent that person from proceeding in any direction in which that person has right to
proceed, he is said to have wrongfully restrained that person. Section 339 of the IPC,
1860 requires that the accused should have obstructed a person from proceeding in
any direction in which he has the right to proceed and when he obstructs any person
and restrains him from proceeding in any direction he commits the offence of wrongful
restraint punishable under section 341 of the IPC, 1860.912. Whoever obstructs a
person from proceeding to a direction to which that person has a right to proceed,
commits an offence of wrongful restraint. While dealing with the offence which is
punishable under section 341 of IPC, 1860 and which has been defined by section 339
of IPC, 1860 the Court is obliged to see following ingredients:
(1) Whether the person so obstructed had a lawful right to proceed to a direction to
which he has been obstructed;
(2) Whether such obstruction was for enforcement of a legal right of the obstructer.
(3) Whether such obstructer obstructed such person in good faith. It has to be kept
in mind that nothing can be said to be done in good faith which is not done with
due care and caution. If these ingredients are indicated by the complaint, the
Magistrate is obliged to take the cognizance of the complaint so presented
before him unless there are the other grounds for acting otherwise which has to
be justified by reasons recorded in writing.913.
Where the tenant and his family members were prevented by some other tenants in
league with the landlord from using the main gate by force and abuses, the Court
observed that it was utterly wrong to have dismissed the complaint as a matter of civil
nature.914.
Obstruction contemplated by this section, though physical, may be caused not only by
physical force but also by menaces and threats, the criterion of the offence thereunder
or under section 341 being more the effect than the method.915. The fact of physical
obstruction even by mere words would fall within the ambit of this section.916.
[s 339.2] CASES.—Wrongful restraint.—
Where the accused, a boy of 15 years, caught hold of a man from the back to enable
the main accused, his brother, to attack, it was held that common intention of murder
could not be inferred. Accordingly, his conviction from under sections 302/34 was
converted to one under section 340.917. The driver of a bus purposely made his bus
stand across the road in such a manner as to prevent another bus, which was coming
from behind, to proceed further. It was held that the driver of the first bus was guilty of
wrongful restraint.918. Where the tenants of a housing society converted an open space
within the compound into a garden and cordoned it, this offence was held to have been
committed and though the accused were companies, they could be prosecuted under
this section and section 447.919. Their conduct caused obstruction to the free
movement of other members.
[s 339.3] No wrongful restraint.—
Where a person obstructs a private pathway claimed by way of a right of easement
over his land and which right was not admitted, he does not commit the offence of
wrongful restraint.920. The obstruction under this section has to be to a person and not
to an empty car.921. Where at the behest of a constable the accused stopped some
carts in which rice was being carried by some persons in the bona fide belief that the
rice was being smuggled out, they could not be held liable under section 341, IPC, 1860
even if suspicion ultimately proved to be incorrect, for they would still get the protection
of section 79, IPC, 1860 that is, mistake of fact.922. Where a tenant was partially
obstructed from entering the premises by the closure of one of the door leaves, it was
held that it did not amount to wrongful restraint as he was still free to enter the
premises.923. The wife of the complainant was working as a teacher in a school. The
complainant, a judicial officer, was staying in the quarter allotted to her in the school
compound till he was posted to some other place. Thereafter, he used to visit his family
and was permitted to park his car at a particular place but he was prevented from using
the main gates of the school. He was not restrained from using the passage leading to
the school premises where his wife was allotted residential quarter. It was held that
criminal restraint to a 'person' is punishable but not any obstruction for plying/parking
of a vehicle at a particular place.924. Where the Sarvodaya workers prevented visitors
from entering a liquor shop, it cannot be held an offence under section 339 IPC,
1860.925.
The word "voluntarily" connotes direct physical restraint. There should be restriction on
the normal movement of a person. In this case, the accused person had decided on
behalf of a limited company to get a road repaired and the repair, if carried out, might
have caused some inconvenience to the complainant, it was held that there was no
offence under sections 339 and 341.926.
[s 339.4] Matter of civil nature.—
The right of a co-sharer to enjoy the joint family property is a civil right. Where such
right is denied by other co-shares for one reason or another, the Court said that it
should be enforced by taking recourse to remedies available under the civil laws,
criminal proceedings cannot be resorted for such purposes.927.
