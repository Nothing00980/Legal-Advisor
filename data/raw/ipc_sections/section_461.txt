COMMENT—
Section 450 deals with house trespass in order to commit offence punishable with life
imprisonment. In the case, where the offence punishable with life imprisonment has
been ruled out, one would have to look into actual act of the accused person. The act
of the appellant is that of assaulting the complainant with chopper. The injury caused
by the appellant is a simple injury. In such case, it would not attract life imprisonment
and hence, section 450 of the IPC, 1860 would not be attracted.699.
[s 450.1] Murder and house trespass.—
Where accused entered the house of deceased and killed him by giving sword blow,
and his wife, who was the eye-witness to the incident lodged FIR within a period of
three hours, it was held that accused was rightly convicted under sections 450 and 302
of IPC, 1860.700.
[s 450.2] Rape and House trespass.—
Where the victim aged above 18 years alleged that while she was sleeping, accused
entered her house and she woke-up when he was committing sexual intercourse with
her, and it was proved that she did not bolted door of house from inside and when she
woke-up she did not raise alarm for help, it was held that offences are not made
out.701. Where it was proved that the accused entered the mentally challenged victim's
house, threw her on the cot and after removing her underwear committed forcible
sexual intercourse with her, conviction under section 450 and section 376 IPC, 1860
was upheld.702.

698. Her Chand v State of Rajasthan, 1997 Cr LJ 345 (Raj), entry into parental house to which the
right of access was there. Hence, criminal trespass was not made out. Surjit Singh v State of
Punjab, (2007) 15 SCC 391 [LNIND 2007 SC 724] , 5 policemen were accused of entering into
the house of a woman with the intention to rape her. Their attempt was foiled by her sons who
cried for help. On the suggestion of one of them, the other killed the woman. They were not the
persons before the court. These two were neither involved in killing nor there any evidence of
common intention. Criminal trespass into the house was established against them. They were
convicted for the same.
