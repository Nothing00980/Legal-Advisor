Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace.
Whoever intentionally insults, and thereby gives provocation to any person, intending
or knowing it to be likely that such provocation will cause him to break the public
peace, or to commit any other offence, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This section provides a remedy for using abusive and insulting language. Abusive
language which may lead to a breach of the public peace is not an offence. There must
be an intentional insult. Insult may be offered by words or conduct. If it is by words, the
words must amount to something more than mere vulgar abuse.10. Mere breach of
good manners does not constitute an offence under this section.11. If the insult is of
such a nature that it may give provocation which might rouse a man to act either to
break the public peace or to commit any other offence, the offence is committed.12.
In judging whether a particular abusive language comes within the mischief of section
504, Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860), the Court has to see what would be the effect
of the language used in ordinary course of events and not how the complainant
actually behaved on being abused. Merely because a man of cool temperament did not
react violently or break the peace it does not follow that no offence was committed by
the accused.13. In the absence of actual words used by the accused or even a gist of it
in the complaint it is not possible to say if the case falls within the ambit of section 504
(IPC, 1960), and as such the charge has to be quashed.14. Thus where the only
allegation in the complaint was that when the complainant resisted the attempts by the
accused to evict her forcibly from the land in her tenancy, the accused persons abused
her in filthy words, the complainant not disclosing the actual words used by the
accused or that she was provoked by the insulting abuse, the accused were not
summoned.15.
[s 504.1] Ingredients.—
This section requires two essentials:—
1. Intentionally insulting a person and thereby giving provocation to him.
2. The person insulting must intend or know it to be likely that such provocation will
cause him to break the public peace or to commit any other offence.16.
Mere hurling of abuses in absence of any allegation that such abuses were given
intending or knowingly that such an action would provoke the aggrieved person to
break public peace or to commit an offence does not fall within the definition of the
offence as prescribed under section 504, (IPC, 1860). A bare reading of the section
does not leave any room for doubt that the intentional insult which is given by the
accused should be clothed with the intention or knowledge that such an insult would
provoke the aggrieved person to commit breach of public peace or to commit an
offence.17. Section 504 refers to intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of
peace.
In order to attract the ingredients of an offence under section 504 of the (IPC, 1860), it
would be necessary that actual words used or supposed to have been used should be
mentioned in the complaint/written report, otherwise it would be extremely difficult for
the Court to decide whether or not the words used amounted to an intentional insult.18.
[s 504.2] Sections 499 and 504.—
The difference between an offence under this section and defamation lies in the fact
that in defamation, publication to the prosecutor alone is not sufficient, as such an
imputation could not be said to harm the reputation of the person; but under this
section this would complete the offence.

duty, and not when he abuses or insults a person who is in police lock-up. Abani Ch Biswal v

official duty and sanction is not necessary to prosecute him.
