Concealing design to commit offence punishable with imprisonment.
Whoever, intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate
the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment,
If offence be committed—if offence be not committed.
voluntarily conceals, by any act or illegal omission, the existence of a design to
commit such offence, or makes any representation which he knows to be false
respecting such design,
shall, if the offence be committed, be punished with imprisonment of the
description provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to one-fourth,
and, if the offence be not committed, to one-eighth, of the longest term for such
imprisonment, or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with both.
COMMENT—
Punishment for concealing design.—The basic principle of this section and section
118 is one and the same. Section 118 deals with offences punishable with death or
imprisonment for life; this section deals with offences punishable with imprisonment.
All offences except those punishable only with fine are included in these two sections.
