Attempt to commit suicide.
Whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the commission of
such offence, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may
extend to one year 663.[or with fine, or with both].
COMMENT.—
Suicide by itself is not an offence under either English or Indian Criminal Law, though at
one time it was a felony in England.664. It is a unique legal phenomenon in the IPC,
1860 that the only act, the attempt of which alone will become an offence. The person
who attempts to commit suicide is guilty of the offence under section 309 IPC, 1860
whereas the person who committed suicide cannot be reached at all. Section 306
renders the person who abets the commission of suicide punishable for which the
condition precedent is that suicide should necessarily have been committed.665.
The act done must be in the course of the attempt, otherwise no offence is committed.
Where a woman with the intention of committing suicide by throwing herself in a well,
actually ran towards it, when she was seized by a person, it was held that she might
have changed her mind, and she was caught before she did anything which might have
been regarded as the commencement of the offence.666. Her act simply amounted to
preparation. The pounding of oleander roots with an intention to poison oneself with
the same was held not to constitute this offence.667. Where the accused jumped into a
well to avoid and escape from police, and when rescued he came out of the well of his
own accord, it was held that, in the absence of evidence that he jumped into the well to
commit suicide, he could not be convicted of this offence.668. A village woman of 20
years old was ill-treated by her husband. There was a quarrel between the two, and the
husband threatened that he would beat her. Late that night the woman, taking her six
months' old baby in her arms, slipped away from the house. After she had gone some
distance she heard somebody coming up behind her, and when she turned round and
saw her husband pursuing her, she got into a panic and jumped down a well nearby
with the baby in her arms. The result was that the baby died but the woman recovered.
One of the charges against her was attempt to commit suicide. It was held that she
should not be convicted under this section of an attempt to commit suicide, for the
word "attempt" connotes some conscious endeavour to accomplish the act, and the
accused in jumping down the well was not thinking at all of taking her own life but only
of escaping from her husband.669. If a person openly declares that he will fast to death
and then proceeds to refuse all nourishment until the stage is reached when there is
imminent danger of death ensuing, he can be held guilty under this section but when
the evidence falls short of this, it cannot be said to be sufficient to sustain the
charge.670. A woman who had been suffering from chronic incurable disease retired to
bed with her one and a half-year-old child but was found with the child inside a well
about 200 feet away from her house in the early morning of the next day when they
were both taken out of the well, it was found that though the woman was alive the child
had died. On being prosecuted under sections 302 and 309 IPC, 1860, she denied
having jumped into the well. She further pleaded that she was too ill and there was
something wrong with her brain. The trial Judge did not give her the benefit of section
84 IPC, 1860 and convicted her of both the offences charged. In acquitting her the High
Court of Bombay held that in the absence of any evidence that she deliberately jumped
into the well along with the child, she could not be convicted merely on the basis of
imagination or denied the benefit of section 84 IPC, 1860. In any case, the Judge
should have given her the benefit of doubt.671. Moreover, suspicion however strong is
not proof.672. Where a desolate woman jumped into a well with her two children and
was released with admonition for the offence under section 309 but was sentenced to
imprisonment for three months for the offence under section 307 IPC, 1860, the
Supreme Court directed that she should also be released with admonition for the
offence under section 307 IPC, 1860.673. Witness clearly stated that deceased was
shouting, pleading with the accused to not kill her, when accused gave sword blows to
her. There is no material available to establish that deceased volunteered herself for
death — Exception 5 to section 300 could not be invoked. Conviction and sentence, as
recorded by trial Court under sections 302 and 309 of IPC, 1860 against appellant was
held proper.674.
[s 309.1] Voluntary termination of life.—
A person cannot claim his own life by saying that he had led a successful life and the
mission of his life was fulfilled. It would amount to suicide as it would attract the
provisions of sections 306 and 309. The Court said that no distinction could be made
between suicide as ordinarily understood and the right to voluntarily put an end to one's
life.675.
[s 309.2] Fast-unto-death.—
Where a person commenced fast-unto-death for certain demands but even before his
demands were conceded, he chose to get himself treated medically without protest, it
was held that the mens rea to destroy himself was absent and it could not be said that
he attempted to commit suicide.676.
[s 309.3] Constitutional validity of section 309.—
In P Rathinam v UOI,677.,678. the constitutional validity of section 309 was challenged
and the Supreme Court observed that the provision punishing attempt to commit
suicide is cruel and irrational and is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution and it
deserves to be effaced from the statute book to humanalise penal laws. It added that
the act of attempted suicide has no baneful effect on society and it is also not against
religion, morality or public policy, besides suicide or attempt to commit it causes no
harm to others.
This decision was subsequently reversed and it has been held again that the provision
for penalising attempt to commit suicide and abetment of suicide is not
unconstitutional.679.
The Constitution Bench in a subsequent decision in Gian Kaur v State of Punjab680. and
other connected matters has overruled the view taken in the case of P Rathinam681.
that section 309 IPC, 1860 is constitutionally invalid. It was held that, on the facts
which are not only proved but are also admitted by A1 the acquittal of A1 under section
309, IPC, 1860 has to be set aside and he will have to be convicted under that
section.682.
[s 309.4] The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017
Parliament has now enacted the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 which vide section 115
lays down that:
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 309 of the Indian Penal Code any
person who attempts to commit suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to
have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the said Code.
(2) The appropriate Government shall have a duty to provide care, treatment and
rehabilitation to a person, having severe stress and who attempted to commit suicide,
to reduce the risk of recurrence of attempt to commit suicide.
In view of the above provisions, if a person attempts to commit suicide, it shall be
presumed, unless proved otherwise, that he has severe stress and he shall not be tried
and punished under section 309 of the IPC, 1860. By inverting the presumption against
guilt but retaining the provision in the statute book, attempt to suicide is still a criminal
offence. In order to render conviction, prosecution will be required to lead evidence and
prove that the survivor did not have severe stress and did not suffer any issue of
mental health.
[s 309.5] Euthanasia.—
In India active euthanasia is illegal and a crime under section 302 or at least section
304 IPC, 1860. Physician assisted suicide is a crime under section 306 IPC, 1860
(abetment to suicide). The Constitution Bench in Gian Kaur v State of Punjab,683. held
that both euthanasia and assisted suicide are not lawful in India which overruled the
two Judge Bench decision of the Supreme Court in P Rathinam v UOI.684. The Court
held that the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution does not include the right
to die. But in Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v UOI,685. the Supreme Court held that
passive euthanasia can be allowed under exceptional circumstances under the strict
monitoring of the Court. The difference between 'active' and passive' euthanasia is that
in active euthanasia something is done to end the patient's life while in passive
euthanasia, something is not done that would have preserved the patient's life. It is
usually defined as withdrawing medical treatment with a deliberate intention to causing
the patient's death. In Common Cause (A Regd. Society) v UOI,686. a five-judge
Constitution Bench gave legal sanction to passive euthanasia, permitting 'living will' by
patients on withdrawing medical support if they slip into irreversible coma. The
Supreme Court held that the right to die with dignity is a fundamental right.
[s 309.6] Procedure for passive euthanasia.—
Article 226 gives abundant power to the High Court to pass suitable orders on the
application filed by the near relatives or next friend or the doctors/hospital staff praying
for permission to withdraw the life support to an incompetent person of the kind above
mentioned. When such an application is filed the Chief Justice of the High Court should
forthwith constitute a Bench of at least two Judges who should decide to grant
approval or not. Before doing so the Bench should seek the opinion of a committee of
three reputed doctors to be nominated by the Bench after consulting such medical
authorities/medical practitioners as it may deem fit. Preferably one of the three doctors
should be a neurologist, one should be a psychiatrist, and the third a physician. For this
purpose a panel of doctors in every city may be prepared by the High Court in
consultation with the State Government/Union Territory and their fees for this purpose
may be fixed. The committee of three doctors nominated by the Bench should carefully
examine the patient and also consult the record of the patient as well as taking the
views of the hospital staff and submit its report to the High Court Bench.
Simultaneously with appointing the committee of doctors, the High Court Bench shall
also issue notice to the State and close relatives, e.g., parents, spouse,
brothers/sisters, etc., of the patient, and in their absence his/her next friend, and supply
a copy of the report of the doctor's committee to them as soon as it is available. After
hearing them, the High Court bench should give its verdict. The above procedure
should be followed all over India until Parliament makes legislation on this subject.687.
[s 309.7] Abetment of attempt to commit Suicide.—
Section 306 prescribes punishment for abetment of suicide while section 309 punishes
attempt to commit suicide. The history of use of the provisions of section 309 shows
that the section has been pressed into service primarily in the case of Sati, where the
widow commits suicide and others have various reasons – economic and social, to
abet such hapless woman to commit suicide. If a hapless Sati victim is goaded to
commit suicide and the abetters abet her to jump into the funeral pyre of her husband,
it would be preposterous for law to hold the abetters not guilty of any offence merely
because she escapes or is saved from death later.688.
