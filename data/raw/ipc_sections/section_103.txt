Act causing slight harm.
Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it
is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of
ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.
COMMENT.—
slight harm or trifles.—The maxim de minimis non curat lex (the law takes no account
of trifles) is the foundation of this section. The authors of the Code observe:
Clause 73 [this section] is intended to provide for those cases which, though, from the
imperfections of language, fall within the letter of the penal law, are yet not within its spirit,
and are all over the world considered by the public, and for the most part dealt with by the
tribunals, as innocent. As our definitions are framed, it is theft to dip a pen in another man's
ink, mischief to crumble one of his wafers, an assault to cover him with a cloud of dust by
riding past him, hurt to incommode him by pressing against him in getting into a carriage.
There are innumerable acts without performing which men cannot live together in society,
acts which all men constantly do and suffer in turn, and which it is desirable that they
should do and suffer in turn, yet which differ only in degree from crimes. That these acts
ought not to be treated as crimes is evident, and we think it far better expressly to except
them from the penal clauses of the Code than to leave it to the judges to except them in
practice.253.
The expression 'harm' has been used in this section in a wide sense including physical
injury and hence, this section applies in cases of actual physical injury also. This
section applies not only to acts which are accidental but also to deliberate acts which
cause harm or are intended to cause harm or known to be likely to cause harm.254. In a
campaign by Sarvodaya workers to educate people about the evil of alcohol, liquor
shops were picketed to prevent people from going there even if it was at the cost of
slight harm; their prosecution under section 341 for causing wrongful restraint was
quashed.255. Where the accused locked the complainant inside the factory by pulling
down the shutter, it was held that ingredients of the offence under section 342
(wrongful confinement) were established but as the complainant regained his freedom
within a very short time and only a minimal harm was caused, the case was clearly
covered by section 95.256.
[s 95.1] CASES.—Acts regarded as trivial.—
This section was applied where a person was convicted for taking pods, almost
valueless, from a tree standing on Government waste land;257. where the accused
committed theft of a cheque of no value258. and where the plaintiff complained of the
harm caused to his reputation by the imputation that he was travelling with a wrong
ticket.259. So also an offence of misbranding260. and the conduct of a lawyer in using
filthy language in course of cross-examination261. were treated as trivial.
Where the record of the trial Court showed that the injury caused was very simple,
being in the nature of a scratch, the Court said that the act was so trivial that no person
of a sound common sense would regard it as an offence. The prayer of the
complainant for conviction of the accused for causing simple hurt under section 323
was liable to be rejected.262.
[s 95.2] Acts not regarded as trivial.—
The top most official of the State Police, indecently behaved with a senior lady IAS
Officer, in the presence of gentry and in spite of her raising objections continued with
such behaviour. The Supreme Court observed that if it is held, on the face of such
allegations that, the ignominy and trauma to which, she was subjected to was so slight
that the lady IAS Officer, as a person of ordinary sense and temper, would not complain
about the same, sagacity will be the first casualty. In that view of the matter section 95,
IPC, 1860 cannot have any manner of application to an offence relating to modesty of
woman as under no circumstances can it be trivial.263. Where the Accused caused the
deceased to fall down and co-accused threw down a heavy stone on head of deceased,
act attributed to accused formed part of a joint yet a murderous assault on deceased.
Hence, it is not covered by exception in section 95.264. Where a blow was given across
the chest with an umbrella by a dismissed policeman to a District Superintendent of
Police because his application to reconsider his case was rejected;265. where the
accused tore up a paper which showed a money debt due from him to the prosecutor
though it was unstamped, and therefore, not a legal security;266. and where a
respectable man was taken by the ear,267. it was held that this section did not apply. An
offence under Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 cannot be regarded as
trivial.268.
