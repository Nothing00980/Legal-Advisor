Punishment for public nuisance in cases not otherwise provided for.
Whoever commits a public nuisance in any case not otherwise punishable by this
Code, shall be punished with fine which may extend to two hundred rupees.
COMMENT.—
This section provides for the punishment of a nuisance falling within the four corners
of the definition given in section 268 but not punishable under any other section.
[s 290.1] CASES.—
The display of unauthorized hoardings / banners / posters not only result in
defacement of public property and any place open to public view, but is an eyesore to
the viewers thereby causing public nuisance. In a given case, it may also result in
obstructing the free flow of traffic on the public roads. The same would not only be
unlawful but unjust and unreasonable, irrespective of whether it has the effect of
advertisement or otherwise. Suffice it to observe that the Authorities have a bounden
duty to prevent and regulate display of illegal hoardings / banners / posters in the
interests of amity and public safety.98. Though corporate bodies act through their
agents, there is no reason to exempt such bodies when their agents or servants, while
purporting to act on their behalf commit an offence like public nuisance, which is
punishable with fine only. So a Municipality could be convicted for not maintaining the
cleanliness of the town under section 290, IPC, 1860.99. But in deciding cases of
nuisance the rigid standards of urban society cannot be applied to Indian villages.100.
Where a Coal Depot had been in existence for seven or eight years and only two
neighbours complained against its continuance at that site, it could not be said that it
constituted a public nuisance. At best, it was a private nuisance.101. Playing the radio
loud at a particular time did not constitute public nuisance and it was too trivial a
matter for the Court to take notice of it.102.
