Punishment for extortion.
Whoever commits extortion shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT—
This offence takes a middle place between theft and robbery.
[s 384.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires two things:—
(1) intentionally putting a person in fear of injury to himself or another;
(2) dishonestly inducing the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any
property or valuable security.
These ingredients have been restated by the Supreme Court as follows:
(1) the accused must put any person in fear of injury to him or to any other person;
(2) the putting of a person in such fear must be intentional;
(3) the accused must thereby induce the person so put in fear to deliver to any
person any property or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a
valuable security;
(4) such inducement must be done dishonestly.111.
[s 384.2] Theft and extortion.—
Extortion is thus distinguished from theft—
(1) Extortion is committed by the wrongful obtaining of consent. In theft the
offender takes without the owner's consent.112.
(2) The property obtained by extortion is not limited as in theft to movable property
only. Immovable property may be the subject of extortion.
(3) In extortion the property is obtained by intentionally putting a person in fear of
injury to that person or to any other, and thereby dishonestly inducing him to
part with his property. In theft the element of force does not arise.
1. 'Puts any person in fear of any injury'.—The 'fear' must be of such a nature and
extent as to unsettle the mind of the person on whom it operates, and takes away from
his acts that element of free voluntary action which alone constitutes consent.113.
Thus threatening to expose a clergyman, who had criminal intercourse with a woman in
a house of ill-fame in his own church and village, to his own bishop, and to the
archbishop, and also to publish his shame in the newspapers, was held to be such a
threat as men of ordinary firmness could not be expected to resist.114. The making use
of real or supposed influence to obtain money from a person against his will under
threat, in case of refusal, of loss of appointment, was held to be extortion.115. The
accused husband took his wife to a forest and obtained her ornaments under threats to
kill her. The ornaments were subsequently recovered from him. He was held guilty of
the offence of extortion, not robbery.116.A refusal to allow people to carry away fire-
wood collected in a Government forest without payment of proper fees;117. a payment
taken from the owners of trespassing cattle under the influence of a threat that the
cattle would be impounded if the payment were refused;118. the obtaining of a bond
under the threat of non-rendering of service as a vakil,119. and a refusal to perform a
marriage ceremony and enter the marriage in the register unless the accused was paid
Rs. 5,120. were held not to constitute extortion.
[s 384.3] Threat of criminal accusation.—
The terror of criminal charge, whether true or false, amounts to a fear of injury.121. The
guilt or innocence of the party threatened is immaterial. Even the threat need not be a
threat to accuse before a judicial tribunal, a threat to charge before any third person is
enough.122.
Housing Loan taken by the complainant. Proceedings initiated by issuing notice under
section 13 (2) of SARFAESI Act, 2002 would not amount to extortion.123.
2. 'Dishonestly induces the person … to deliver to any person any property'.— Delivery
by the person put in fear is essential in order to constitute the offence of extortion.
Where a person through fear offers no resistance to the carrying off of his property, but
does not deliver any of the property to those who carry it off, the offence committed
will be robbery and not extortion.124. The offence of extortion is not complete before
actual delivery of the possession of the property by the person put in fear.125.
When the accused honestly believes that the complainant had taken the money
belonging to him (the accused), an attempt to get it back cannot be said to be with the
intention of causing wrongful loss to him.126.
Where the headmaster of a school called a lady teacher to a place where he was alone
and induced her to sign three blank papers by threatening an attack on her modesty,
the Supreme Court held that it amounted to an offence under this section.127.
An accused was charged with the offence of murder by resorting to extortion. The
prosecution failed to prove several particulars relating to the major offence, but proved
the commission of minor offence punishable under section 384 read with section 34.
The conviction of the accused for the minor offences under section 384 read with
section 34 was held to be proper.
[s 384.4] 'To any person'.—
It is not necessary that the threat should be used, and the property received, by one and
the same individual. It may be a matter of arrangement between several persons that
the threats should be used by some, and property received by others; and they all would
be guilty of extortion.128.
[s 384.5] CASES.—
The accused persons came to the place of their victims with fire arms and forced them
to handover their gun. The accused then abducted them and shot them dead in nearby
orchard. The Court said that all of them who came there to commit extortion must be
attributed knowledge that killings might take place in the prosecution of their object. All
of them were held vicariously liable for murder. Their conviction under sections
384/149 and 302/149 was proper.129.
[s 384.6] Compounding.—
The offences under sections 384 and 506 Part II IPC, 1860 are not compoundable
under section 320 of the Cr PC, 1973. Therefore, the prayer of compounding the
offences made by the complainant and A1 in their joint application supported by their
affidavits cannot be legally accepted.130.
