False charge of offence made with intent to injure.
Whoever, with intent to cause injury1 to any person, institutes or causes to be
instituted any criminal proceedings2 against that person, or falsely charges3 any
person with having committed an offence, knowing that there is no just or lawful
ground4 for such proceeding or charge against that person, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with
fine, or with both; and if such criminal proceeding be instituted5 on a false charge of
an offence punishable with death, 223.[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment for
seven years or upwards, shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.—
This section includes two distinct offences:—
(1) Actually instituting or causing to be instituted false criminal proceeding against
a person.224.
(2) Preferring a false charge against a person.
The first assumes the second, but the second may be committed where no criminal
proceedings follow.
The necessary ingredients to constitute either of the above offences are—
(1) the criminal proceedings must be instituted, or the false charge made with
intent to injure;
(2) the criminal proceedings must be instituted, or the false charge must be made,
without just or lawful ground, in other words, it must be made maliciously.
Difference is made in punishment according as the charge relates to offences
punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more or otherwise.
The mere making of a false charge is punishable under the first part of the section. If a
case gets no further than a police inquiry, it falls within that part. But under the second
part there should be an actual institution of criminal proceedings on a false charge.225.
Two conditions are necessary before the enhanced punishment provided in the second
paragraph could be inflicted: (1) proceedings on the false charge should have been
actually instituted, and (2) the false charge must be in respect of an offence punishable
with death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or upwards.
[s 211.1] Sections 182 and 211.—
According to the Bombay High Court there is a clear distinction between a false charge
that falls under section 211 and false information given to the police, in which latter
case the offence falls under section 182. A person prosecuting another under section
182 need not prove malice and want of reasonable and probable cause except so far
as they are implied in the act of giving information known to be false, with the
knowledge or likelihood that such information would lead a public servant to use his
power to the injury or annoyance of the complainant. In an inquiry under section 211,
on the other hand, proof of the absence of just and lawful ground for making the
charge is an important element.226. If the information conveyed to the police amounts
to the institution of criminal proceedings against a defined person or amounts to the
falsely charging of a defined person with an offence, then the person giving such
information is guilty of an offence under section 211. In such a case, section 211 is,
and section 182 is not, the appropriate section under which to frame a charge. Section
182, when read with section 211, must be understood as referring to cases where the
information given to the public servant falls short of amounting to institution of
criminal proceedings against a defined person and falls short of amounting to the
falsely charging of a defined person with an offence as defined in the Penal Code.227.
The Calcutta, the Madras, the Allahabad and the Patna High Courts differ from this
view of the Bombay High Court. The Calcutta High Court has ruled that a prosecution
for a false charge may be under section 182 or section 211, but if the false charge was
a serious one, the graver section 211 should be applied and the trial should be full and
fair.228. Where a false charge is made to the police of a cognizable offence the offence
committed by the person making the charge falls within the meaning of section 211
and not section 182.229.
The Madras High Court has held that there is no error in a conviction under section 182,
when the false charge made before the police was punishable under the final clause of
section 211. The High Court may quash the conviction and sentence for the minor
offence and direct a trial before a tribunal having jurisdiction for the graver offence.
Whether it will do so, or not, is a question, not of law, but of expediency on the facts of
the particular case.230.
The Allahabad High Court had held that where a specific false charge is made, the
proper section, for proceedings to be adopted under section 211.231. Although it is
difficult to see what case would arise under section 211 to which section 182 could not
be applied yet section 182 would apply to a case that might not fall under section 211.
The offence under section 182 is complete when false information is given to a public
servant by a person who believes it to be false, but who intends thereby to cause such
public servant to institute criminal proceedings against a third person. The offence is
complete although the public servant takes no steps towards the institution of such
criminal proceedings. There is no restriction imposed by the Penal Code or by the
Criminal Procedure Code upon the prosecution of an offence either under section 182
or section 211. It appears that it has been left to the discretion of the Court to
determine when and under what circumstances prosecution should be proceeded with
under sections 182 and 211.232. The soundness of this view is doubted in subsequent
cases.233.
The Patna High Court has followed the view of the Calcutta High Court.234.
The Lahore High Court has held that an offence under section 182 is included in the
more serious offence under section 211 and a prosecution for a false charge may be
either under section 182 or section 211, though clearly if section 211 does apply and
the false charge is serious, the prosecution should be under section 211.235.
1. 'Intent to cause injury'.—This is an essential part of the offence.236.
2. 'Institutes or causes to be instituted any criminal proceedings'.—The word
"proceedings" is used in this section in the ordinary sense of a prescribed mode of
action for prosecuting a right or redressing a wrong. It is not used in the technical
sense of a proceeding taken in a Court of law.237. Neither the proceedings before the
Disciplinary Committee of the Bar Council of India, is a criminal proceeding nor was the
charge in the Disciplinary Proceedings in relation to an offence. Charge in the
Disciplinary Proceedings before the Bar Council of India is only in respect of
professional misconduct and not offence as such.238. Under this section 'instituting a
criminal proceeding' may be treated as an offence in itself apart from 'falsely charging'
a person with having committed an offence. There are two modes in which a person
aggrieved may seek to put the criminal law in motion: (1) by giving information to the
police (Criminal Procedure Code, section 154) and (2) by lodging a complaint before a
Magistrate (Criminal Procedure Code, sections 190, 200). A person who sets the
criminal law in motion by making to the police a false charge in respect of a cognizable
offence institutes criminal proceedings.239. But as the police have no power to take any
proceedings in non-cognizable cases without orders from a Magistrate, a false charge
of such offence, made to the police, is not an institution of criminal proceedings, but
merely a false charge.240. The distinction between cognizable and non-cognizable
offences relates to the powers of the police only, and it will, therefore, seem that the
false charge of any offence, whether cognizable or non-cognizable, before a Magistrate
is an institution of criminal proceedings.
3. 'Falsely charges'.—The word 'charges' means something different from 'gives
information'. The true test seems to be, does the person who makes the statement that
is alleged to constitute the 'charge' do so with the intention and object of setting the
criminal law in motion against the person against whom the statement is directed?
Such object and intention may be inferred from the language of the statement and the
circumstances in which it is made.241. The false charge must be made to a Court, or to
an officer who has power to investigate and send it up for trial.242. Where the tribunal
before whom the complaint is made is not competent to take any action direct or
indirect to punish the persons complained against, it cannot be said that the accused
'charged' such persons with any offence or that his intention necessarily was that
action should be taken against them.243. A false petition to the Superintendent of
Police, praying for the protection of the petitioners from the oppression of a Sub-
Inspector, which may be effected by some departmental action, does not amount to
such a false charge.244. It is enough that a false charge is made though no prosecution
is instituted thereon.245. Where a person who gives false information as to the
commission of an offence merely states that he suspected a certain other person to be
the offender, it may be that he would not be liable under this section, but where it is
clear that the informant's intention was not merely that the police should follow up a
clue but that they should put the alleged offender on trial, the informant is guilty of an
offence under this section.246. The Calcutta High Court has held that the meaning of
the expression 'falsely charges' is simply 'falsely accuses' and as the section stands
there is no necessity of this false accusation being made in connection with a criminal
proceeding.247.
[s 211.2] Giving false Evidence: No false charge.—
The words "falsely charges" in this section cannot mean giving false evidence against
the accused as a prosecution witness during the course of a trial. To "falsely charge"
must refer to the criminal or initial accusation putting or seeking to put in motion the
machinery of criminal investigation and not when seeking to prove the false charge by
making deposition in support of the charge framed in that trial. The words "falsely
charges" have to be read along with the expression "institution of criminal
proceedings". The false charge must, therefore, be made initially to a person in
authority or to someone who is in a position to get the offender punished by
appropriate proceedings. In other words it must be embodied either in a complaint or in
a report of a cognizable offence to the police-officer or to an officer having authority
over the person against whom the allegations are made. Giving false evidence in
course of a trial amounts to an offence under sections 193 and 195 and not under
section 211, IPC, 1860.248.
[s 211.3] Bare statement is not false charge.—
A statement to the police of a suspicion that a particular person has committed an
offence is not a charge within the meaning of this section, nor does it amount to
institution of criminal proceedings; and a conviction cannot be had on proof that the
suspicion was unfounded.249. The accused made a report to the police that his buffalo
had been poisoned and that he suspected two persons whom he named of having
administered the poison. The police made an inquiry and reported that there was no
case of poisoning and the charge was struck off. One of the persons then brought a
complaint under this section against the accused. It was held that the report to the
police did not amount to a charge of a criminal offence.250.
[s 211.4] Statement under section 162, Criminal Procedure Code.—
A statement under section 162, Criminal Procedure Code, in answer to questions put by
a police-officer making an investigation under section 161 of the Code, cannot be made
the basis of a prosecution under this section.251. False identification in a Test
Identification Parade is not falsely charging.252.
4. 'Knowing that there is no just or lawful ground'.—This expression is the equivalent of
the English technical phrase "without reasonable or probable cause," which means an
honest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon
reasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances, which, assuming
them to be true, would reasonably lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man, placed
in the position of the accuser, to the conclusion that the person charged was probably
guilty of the crime imputed. There must be:
First, an honest belief of the accuser in the guilt of the accused;
Second, such belief must be based on an honest conviction of the existence of the
circumstances which led the accuser to that conclusion;
Third, such belief must be based upon reasonable grounds; that is, such grounds as
would lead any fairly cautious man in the defendant's situation so to believe;
Fourth, the circumstances so believed and relied on by the accuser must be such as
amount to reasonable ground for belief in the guilt of the accused.253.
A person may, in good faith, institute a charge that is subsequently found to be false, or
he may, with intent to cause injury to an enemy, institute criminal proceedings against
him, believing there are good grounds for them but in neither case has he committed
an offence under this section. To constitute this offence it must be shown that the
person instituting criminal proceedings knew there was no just or lawful ground for
such proceedings.254.
In the absence of any special circumstances to rebut it, the judgment of one competent
tribunal against the complainant affords very strong evidence of reasonable and
probable cause.255.
5. 'If such criminal proceeding be instituted'.—There is a divergence of views between
the Calcutta, the Madras and the Patna High Courts on the one hand, and the Allahabad
and the Lahore High Courts on the other, on the question whether the latter part of the
section applies to such cases of complaints to the police which are disposed of
without a formal magisterial inquiry. A Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court has held
that the latter part would apply to such cases where the charge related to the more
serious offence.256. This case is followed by the Madras257. and the Patna258. High
Courts. The test to apply is,—did the person who made the charge intend to set the
criminal law in motion against the person on whom the charge is made.259.
The Allahabad High Court has, on the other hand, held that to constitute the offence
defined in the second paragraph of this section, it is necessary that criminal
proceedings should be instituted. Where the offence committed does not go further
than the making of a false charge to the police, the making of such charge does not
amount to institution of criminal proceedings, and the offence committed will fall
within the first paragraph, notwithstanding that the offence so falsely charged may be
one of those referred to in the second paragraph.260. The former Chief Court of the
Punjab held likewise.261.
[s 211.5] Complaint by Court: when.—
A complaint alleging commission of an offence punishable under section 211 IPC,
1860, "in or in relation to any proceedings in any Court", is maintainable only at the
instance of that Court or by an officer of that Court authorized in writing for that
purpose or some other Court to which that Court is subordinate, is abundantly clear
from the language employed in the provision.262. When the offence under section 211,
IPC, 1860, is committed in relation to Court proceedings, cognizance without Court's
complaint is barred by section 195 (1)(b)(i), Cr PC, 1973.263. Since an order of a
Magistrate discharging an accused on submission of a police report under section 173,
Cr PC, 1973, is a judicial and not administrative order, a complaint by the Magistrate or
his superior Court under section 195(1)(b)(i), Cr PC, 1973, would be necessary to take
cognizance of an offence under section 211, IPC, 1860.264. Similarly, remand and bail
proceedings too have been held to be Court proceedings and as such a complaint by
the Court would be necessary to take cognizance of the offence under section 211,
IPC, 1860.265. This view of the law has now been affirmed by the Supreme Court as
well.266.
[s 211.6] Proceedings in any Court.—
There are three situations that are likely to emerge while examining the question
whether there is any proceedings in any Court, namely,
(a) there might not be any proceeding in any Court at all,
(b) proceeding in a Court might actually be pending at the relevant time when
cognizance is sought to be taken of the offence punishable under section 211, IPC,
1860 and
(c) there might have been proceedings which had already been concluded though there
might not be any proceedings pending in any Court when cognizance of offence under
section 211, IPC, 1860 is taken. It is only in second and third situation that section
195(1), Cr PC, 1973 would apply. The fact that proceedings had been concluded would
not be material because section 195(1) does not require that proceedings in any Court
must actually be pending at the time when the question of applying the bar arises if the
offence under section 211, IPC, 1860 is alleged to have been committed in relation to
those proceedings.267. A complaint by the concerned Executive Magistrate could be
necessary under section 195(1)(a)(i), and there could be no sufficient reason for
dispensing with the necessity for a complaint by him for prosecution of an offence
under section 211, IPC, 1860 committed in relation to a proceeding before him under
section 144, Cr PC, 1973.268.
[s 211.7] Sections 211 and 500 IPC, 1860.—
If we read sections 211 and 500 of IPC, 1860 together, we would find a clear
distinction. Section 211 imposes a punishment in case of a false charge or offence
made with the intent to injure someone before any Court of law, whereas section 500
provides for punishment in case of a defamation of a person by any one. Defamation
has been defined under section 499 which provides inter alia whoever, by words either
spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or
publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or
having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person,
is said, except in the cases hereinafter excepted, to defame that person. Making a false
complaint before a Court of law would amount to committing fraud on Court. It is for
the Court to proceed against the erring person. The provision has been made to
preserve the sanctity of the Court. Section 500 gives right to sue to a person who is
defamed within the meaning of section 499 by the conduct of the accused. These two
provisions are totally distinct and can be tried in absence of each other.269.
[s 211.8] Civil remedy.—
A person aggrieved by a false charge may, if he chooses, sue in a civil Court for
damages for malicious prosecution, instead of taking criminal proceedings under this
section.
[s 211.9] CASES.—
It was alleged that petitioner's son was kidnapped by opposite party, petitioner's son
himself appeared and made his statement that he was not kidnapped, rather he had
himself voluntarily gone to marry with a girl. The girl also had appeared and made her
statement that petitioner's son and herself have married and for that reason the
petitioner threatening to kill them. It was held that the order, taking cognizance of
offences against petitioner for falsely implicating the opposite party, is proper.270.
[s 211.10] False charge should be made to Court or officer having jurisdiction
to investigate.—
A woman appeared before the Station Staff Officer and accused a non-commissioned
officer of rape, and, after a military inquiry, the military authority held that the charge
was false and directed the complainant to be prosecuted under this section. The
conviction was set aside, as the false charge was not made to a Court having
jurisdiction.271. Where the accused laid a charge of mischief by fire at a police station,
which was reported to be false, and the District Magistrate, upon the receipt of a report
to the same effect from the Deputy Magistrate, to whom he had sent the case for a
judicial inquiry, passed an order to prosecute the accused, it was held that the order of
the District Magistrate was bad, as the matter of the false charge had not come before
him in the course of judicial proceedings.272.
Where a letter falsely charging a person with having committed an offence was written
and posted at Kumbakonam and was addressed to the Inspector-General of Police,
Madras, an offence under this section could be said to be completed only when the
letter reached the destination, i.e., the office of the Inspector-General of Police, Madras.
The communication of the false accusation was, in fact, the laying of the false charge
and, unless the matter was actually communicated to the superior officer, it could not
be said that a false charge had been made. So, the Magistrate at Kumbakonam would
have no territorial jurisdiction to try the case.273.

held to be proper. The office bearers of an Institute hatched a plot to bring about expulsion of
the complainant and his wife, prima facie on false basis.
