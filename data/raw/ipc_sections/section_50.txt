"Illegal." "Legally bound to do.".
The word "illegal" is applicable to everything which is an offence or which is
prohibited by law, or which furnishes ground for a civil action; and a person is said to
be "legally bound to do" whatever it is illegal in him to omit.
COMMENT—
The word `illegal' in the section has been given a very wide meaning. It consists of
three ingredients: (1) everything which is an offence; (2) everything which is prohibited
by law and (3) everything which furnishes ground for civil action.308. The words "legally
bound" do not necessarily only mean the law made by the legislature or statutory law.
Section 43 IPC, 1860 contains a definition of a person being legally bound to do, that is,
a person is stated to be legally bound to do whatever it is illegal in him to omit.309.
The expression "legally bound to do" carries very wide meaning where any ground for
civil action can be founded on the basis of any act or omission on the part of a person,
his act may be held to be illegal or it may be held that he was legally bound to do an act
which he had omitted to do. If a person breaches a departmental order, he may be held
guilty as he was legally bound to act in terms of the order.310.
Sexual contact between two persons with consent but out of marriage does not
amount to an illegal act.311.
[s 43.1] "Ground for civil action."—
In order to constitute a ground for a civil action there must be the right in a party which
can be enforced. It may be breach of a contract or a claim for damages or any such
similar right accruing under the law. There is no law which debars the Chief Minister
from participating in a sale conducted by any Government Department or any of the
corporation or any public sector undertaking affording a cause for civil action
particularly when no fraud or illegal gain is involved. There was nothing in the charge to
indicate, nor did the prosecution take a specific stand that the purchase of the property
of the Government company furnished a ground for a civil action. The nature of the civil
action should not be left to a guess work. The accused could not be expected to meet
such a case at any subsequent stage.312.
[s 43.2] "Illegal" and "unlawful".—
The expression "illegal" and "unlawful" are synonymous and convey the same idea in
language - ordinary and legal. But when a statute employs an expression with intention
of conveying a special meaning and with the said purpose defines the expression in
such statute as the expression "illegal" is defined in section 43 of the IPC, 1860, such
meaning is to be ascertained for that expression specially and specifically for such a
statute and for the purpose of such statute. Merely because two expressions mean the
same ordinarily in language and law, both cannot be held to have the same meaning
when one of them is specially and specifically defined and explained in one statute. So
reckoned, it cannot be accepted that the definition of the expression "illegal" in section
43 of the IPC, 1860 must straightaway be mechanically imported into section 98 of the
Cr PC, 1973 when we consider the ambit and play of the expression "unlawful" in
section 98 of the Cr PC, 1973.313.
