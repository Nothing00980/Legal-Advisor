Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.
A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code, if the
consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, 1
and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was
given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or
Consent of insane person.
if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or
intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which
he gives his consent; or
Consent of child.
unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person
who is under twelve years of age.
COMMENT.—
This section does not define 'consent' but describes what not consent is.
This section says that consent is not a true consent if it is given—
(1) by a person under fear of injury; and the person obtaining the consent knows or
has reason to believe this.
(2) by a person under a misconception of fact;
(3) by a person of unsound mind; and who is unable to understand the nature
(4) by a person who is intoxicated; and consequence of that to which he gives his
consent.
(5) by a person under 12 years of age
Consent is an act of reason, accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing as in
balance, the good and evil on each side.222. Consent means an active will in the mind
of a person to permit the doing of the act complained of, and knowledge of what is to
be done, or of the nature of the act that is being done, is essential to consent to an
act.223. An act of helplessness on the face of inevitable compulsions is not consent in
law.224. It requires voluntary participation by victim not only after exercise of
intelligence based on knowledge of significance and moral quality of act, but after
having fully exercised the choice between resistance and assent.225. A mere act of
helpless resignation in the face of inevitable compulsion, non-resistance and passive
giving in cannot be deemed to be consent.226. The Supreme Court in a long line of
cases has given wider meaning to the word 'consent' in the context of sexual offences
as explained in various judicial dictionaries. In Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law
(Second Edn), vol (1) 1977 at p 422 the word 'consent' has been explained as an act of
reason accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a balance, the good or
evil on either side. It is further stated that consent supposes three things–a physical
power, a mental power, and a free and serious use of them and if consent be obtained
by intimidation, force, meditated imposition, circumvention, surprise, or undue
influence, it is to be treated as a delusion, and not as a deliberate and free act of the
mind.227. Section 90 cannot be considered as an exhaustive definition of consent for
the purposes of IPC, 1860. The normal connotation and concept of consent is not
intended to be excluded.228. For determining whether consent given by the prosecutrix
was voluntary or under a misconception of fact, no straitjacket formula can be laid
down.229.
The factors set out in the first part are from the point of view of the victim. The second
part enacts the corresponding provision from the point of view of the accused. It
envisages that the accused too has the knowledge or reason to believe that the
consent was given by the victim in consequence of fear of injury or misconception of
fact. The requirements of both the parts have to be cumulatively satisfied.230.
Submission of the body under the fear of terror cannot be construed as a consented
sexual act. Consent for the purpose of section 375 requires voluntary participation not
only after the exercise of intelligence based on the knowledge of the significance and
moral quality of the act but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance
and assent. Whether there was consent or not, is to be ascertained only on a careful
study of all relevant circumstances.231. Consent can be obtained under various
methods and always necessarily need not be a one which is given voluntarily. For
example, if a victim is intoxicated without her knowledge or consent and if the rape is
committed while the victim was intoxicated or drunken, it cannot be said that she had
voluntarily given the consent. Therefore, such passive consent cannot be treated as a
consent as contemplated by section 90 of IPC, 1860.232. Obtaining consent by
exercising deceit cannot be legitimate defence to exculpate an accused.233.
[s 90.1] Submission to Rape.—
An act of submission does not involve consent- Consent cannot be equated to inability
to resist or helplessness.234. Every consent involves a submission, but every
submission is not consent and the mere fact that a woman had submitted to the
promise of the accused does not necessarily indicate that her consent existed unless
the evidence on record establishes that the sexual act, which the prosecutrix had
allowed, was accompanied with deliberation after the mind had weighed, as in a
balance, the good and the evil on each side with the existing capacity and power to
withdraw the assent according to one's will or pleasure.235. Where, the accused had
sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix by giving false assurance to her that he would
marry her and when she became pregnant, he refused to do so, it was evident that he
never intended to marry her and procured her consent only for the reason of having
sexual relations with her, therefore, the act of the accused fell squarely under the
definition of rape as her consent was obtained under a misconception of fact.236.
1. 'Misconception of fact'.—The expression "under a misconception of fact" is broad
enough to include all cases where the consent is obtained by misrepresentation; the
misrepresentation should be regarded as leading to a misconception of the facts with
reference to which the consent is given. In section 3 of the Evidence Act Illustration (d)
states that a person has a certain intention is treated as a fact. So, here the fact about
which the second and third prosecution witnesses were made to entertain a
misconception was the fact that the second accused intended to get the girl married...
"thus... if the consent of the person from whose possession the girl is taken is obtained
by fraud, the taking is deemed to be against the will of such a person…" Although in
cases of contracts a consent obtained by coercion or fraud is only voidable by the party
affected by it, the effect of section 90 IPC, 1860 is that such consent cannot, under the
criminal law, be availed of to justify what would otherwise be an offence.237. Consent
may be express or implied, coerced or misguided, obtained willingly or through deceit.
Consent is an act of reason, accompanied by deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a
balance, the good and evil on each side. There is a clear distinction between rape and
consensual sex and in a case like this, the Court must very carefully examine whether
the accused had actually wanted to marry the victim, or had mala fide motives, and had
made a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the latter falls within the
ambit of cheating or deception. There is a distinction between the mere breach of a
promise, and not fulfilling a false promise. Thus, the Court must examine whether there
was made, at an early stage a false promise of marriage by the accused; and whether
the consent involved was given after wholly, understanding the nature and
consequences of sexual indulgence. There may be a case where the prosecutrix agrees
to have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for the accused, and not
solely on account of misrepresentation made to her by the accused, or where an
accused on account of circumstances which he could not have foreseen, or which were
beyond his control, was unable to marry her, despite having every intention to do so.
Such cases must be treated differently. An accused can be convicted for rape only if
the Court reaches a conclusion that the intention of the accused was mala fide, and
that he had clandestine motives.238. In order to come within the meaning of
misconception of fact, the fact must have an immediate relevance. If a fully grown-up
girl consents to the act of sexual intercourse on a promise of marriage and continues
to indulge in such activity until she becomes pregnant, it is an act of promiscuity on her
part and not an act induced by misconception of fact and it was held that section 90
IPC, 1860 cannot be invoked unless the Court can be assured that from the inception
the accused never intended to marry her. Therefore, it depends on case to case that
what is the evidence led in the matter. If it is a fully grown-up girl who gave the consent
then it is a different case but a girl whose age is very tender and she is giving a consent
after persuasion of three months on the promise that the accused will marry her which
he never intended to fulfil right from the beginning which is apparent from the conduct
of the accused, in our opinion, section 90 can be invoked.239. A promise to marry
without anything more will not give rise to "misconception of fact" within the meaning
of section 90, it needs to be clarified that a representation deliberately made by the
accused with a view to elicit the assent of the victim without having the intention or
inclination to marry her, will vitiate the consent. If on the facts it is established that at
the very inception of the making of promise, the accused did not really entertain the
intention of marrying her and the promise to marry held out by him was a mere hoax,
the consent ostensibly given by the victim will be of no avail to the accused to
exculpate him from the ambit of section 375 clause second.240.
[s 90.2] CASES.—
The prosecutrix had sexual intercourse with the accused on the representation made
by the accused that he would marry her. This was a false promise held out by the
accused. Had this promise not been given perhaps, she would not have permitted the
accused to have sexual intercourse. It appears that the intention of the accused was,
right from the beginning, not honest and he kept on promising that he will marry her, till
she became pregnant. This kind of consent obtained by the accused cannot be said to
be any consent because she was under a misconception of fact that the accused
intends to marry her, therefore, she had submitted to sexual intercourse with him.241. In
Uday v State of Karnataka,242. the Court considered the following facts: (i) where a girl
was of 19 years of age and had sufficient intelligence to understand the significance
and moral quality of the act she was consenting to; (ii) she was conscious of the fact
that her marriage was difficult on account of caste considerations; (iii) it was difficult to
impute to the appellant, knowledge that the prosecutrix had consented in consequence
of a misconception of the fact arising from his promise; and (iv) there was no evidence
to prove conclusively that the appellant never intended to marry the prosecutrix. On the
basis of the above factors, Court held that it did not feel persuaded to hold that consent
was obtained by misconception of facts on the part of the victim.
In a case, the prosecutrix had left her home voluntarily, of her own free will to get
married to the accused. She was 19 years of age at the relevant time and was, hence,
capable of understanding the complications and issues surrounding her marriage to
the appellant. According to the version of events provided by her, the prosecutrix had
called the accused on a number given to her by him, to ask him why he had not met her
at the place that had been pre-decided by them. She also waited for him for a long time,
and when he finally arrived she went with him to the Karna Lake where they indulged in
sexual intercourse. She did not raise any objection at this stage and made no
complaints to anyone. Thereafter, she also went to Kurukshetra with the accused,
where she lived with his relatives. Here to, the prosecutrix voluntarily became intimate
with the accused. She then, for some reason, went to live in the hostel at Kurukshetra
University illegally, and once again came into contact with the accused at the Birla
Mandir. Thereafter, she even proceeded with the accused to the old bus-stand in
Kurukshetra, to leave for Ambala so that the two of them could get married. However,
they were apprehended by the police. If the prosecutrix was in fact going to Ambala to
marry the accused, as stands fully established from the evidence on record, the
Supreme Court held it fails to understand on what basis the allegation of "false
promise of marriage" has been raised by the prosecutrix.243.
