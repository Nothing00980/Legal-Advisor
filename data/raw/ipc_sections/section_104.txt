Things done in private defence.
Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.
COMMENT.—
In a civilised society the defence of person and property of every member thereof is the
responsibility of the State. Consequently, there is a duty cast on every person faced
with apprehension of imminent danger of his person or property to seek the aid of the
machinery provided by the State but if immediately such aid is not available, he has the
right of private defence. Right to private defence is a very valuable right and it has been
recognized in all civilized and democratic societies within certain reasonable limits.
Sections 96–106 of IPC, 1860 codify the entire law relating to right of private defence
of person and property including the extent of and the limitation to exercise of such
right. When enacting sections 96 to 106 of the IPC, 1860, excepting from its penal
provisions, certain classes of acts, done in good faith for the purpose of repelling
unlawful aggressions, the Legislature clearly intended to arouse and encourage the
manly spirit of self-defence amongst the citizens, when faced with grave danger.269.
[s 96.1] Principle.—
The basic principle underlying the doctrine of the right of private defence is that when
an individual or his property is faced with a danger and immediate aid from the State
machinery is not readily available, that individual is entitled to protect himself and his
property.270. The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly
confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation.
That being so, the necessary corollary is that the violence which the citizen defending
himself or his property is entitled to use must not be unduly disproportionate to the
injury which is sought to be averted or which is reasonably apprehended and should
not exceed its legitimate purpose. The law does not require a law abiding citizen to
behave like a coward when confronted with an imminent unlawful aggression. There is
nothing more degrading to the human spirit than to run away in face of danger. The
right of private defence is thus, designed to serve a social purpose and deserves to be
fostered within the prescribed limits. The IPC, 1860 defines homicide in self-defence as
a form of substantive right, and therefore, save and except the restrictions imposed on
the right of the Code itself, it seems that the special rule of English Law as to the duty
of retreating will have no application to this country where there is a real need for
defending oneself against deadly assaults. The right to protect one's own person and
property against the unlawful aggressions of others is a right inherent in man. The duty
of protecting the person and property of others is a duty which man owes to society of
which he is a member and the preservation of which is both his interest and duty. It is,
indeed, a duty which flows from human sympathy.
As Bentham said:
It is a noble movement of the heart, that indignation which kindles at the sight of the feeble
injured by the strong. It is noble movement which makes us forget our danger at the first cry
of distress..... It concerns the public safety that every honest man should consider himself
as the natural protector of every other.
But such protection must not be extended beyond the necessities of the case;
otherwise it will encourage a spirit or lawlessness and disorder. The right has,
therefore, been restricted to offences against the human body and those relating to
aggression on property. Right of private defence of person and property is recognized
in all free, civilised, democratic societies within certain reasonable limits. Those limits
are dictated by two considerations: (1) that the same right is claimed by all other
members of the society and (2) that it is the State which generally undertakes the
responsibility for the maintenance of law and order. The citizens, as a general rule, are
neither expected to run away for safety when faced with grave and imminent danger to
their person or property as a result of unlawful aggression, nor are they expected, by
use of force, to right the wrong done to them or to punish the wrong doer of
commission of offences.271.
[s 96.2] Scope.—
Section 96 IPC, 1860 provides that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise
of the right of private defence. The section does not define the expression "right of
private defence". It merely indicates that nothing is an offence which is done in the
exercise of such right.272. While providing for exercise of the right, care has been taken
in IPC, 1860 not to provide and has not devised a mechanism whereby an attack may
be a pretence for killing. A right to defend does not include a right to launch an
offensive, particularly when the need to defend no longer survived.273. Just because
one circumstance exists amongst the various factors, which appears to favour the
person claiming right of self-defence, does not mean that he gets the right to cause the
death of the other person. Even the right of self-defence has to be exercised directly in
proportion to the extent of aggression.274.
[s 96.3] Test.—
Whether in a particular set of circumstances, a person legitimately acted in the
exercise of the right of private defence is a question of fact to be determined on the
facts and circumstances of each case. No test in the abstract for determining such a
question can be laid down. In determining this question of fact, the Court must
consider all the surrounding circumstances. It is not necessary for the accused to
plead in so many words that he acted in self-defence. If the circumstances show that
the right of private defence was legitimately exercised, it is open to the Court to
consider such a plea.275. The means and the force a threatened person adopts at the
spur of the moment to ward off the danger and to save himself or his property cannot
be weighed in golden scales. It is neither possible nor prudent to lay down abstract
parameters which can be applied to determine as to whether the means and force
adopted by the threatened person was proper or not. Answer to such a question
depends upon host of factors like the prevailing circumstances at the spot; his feelings
at the relevant time; the confusion and the excitement depending on the nature of
assault on him etc. Nonetheless, the exercise of the right of private defence can never
be vindictive or malicious. It would be repugnant to the very concept of private
defence.276. A person who is apprehending death or bodily injury cannot weigh in
golden scales in the spur of moment and in the heat of circumstances, the number of
injuries required to disarm the assailants who were armed with weapons. In moments
of excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium it is often difficult to expect the parties
to preserve composure and use exactly only so much force in retaliation
commensurate with the danger apprehended to him where assault is imminent by use
of force, it would be lawful to repel the force in self-defence and the right of private
defence commences, as soon as the threat becomes so imminent. Such situations
have to be pragmatically viewed and not with high powered spectacles or microscopes
to detect slight or even marginal overstepping. Due weightage has to be given to, and
hyper technical approach has to be avoided in considering what happens on the spur of
the moment on the spot and keeping in view normal human reaction and conduct,
where self-preservation is the paramount consideration. But, if the fact situation shows
that in the guise of self-preservation, what really has been done is to assault the
original aggressor, even after the cause of reasonable apprehension has disappeared,
the plea of right of private defence can legitimately be negatived. The Court dealing
with the plea has to weigh the material to conclude whether the plea is acceptable. It is
essentially, as noted above, a finding of fact.277. Situations have to be judged from the
subjective point of view of the accused concerned in the surrounding excitement and
confusion of the moment, confronted with a situation of peril and not by any
microscopic and pedantic scrutiny. In adjudging the question as to whether more force
than was necessary was used in the prevailing circumstances on the spot it would be
inappropriate, as held by this Court, to adopt tests by detached objectivity which would
be so natural in a Court room, or that which would seem absolutely necessary to a
perfectly cool bystander. The person facing a reasonable apprehension of threat to
himself cannot be expected to modulate his defence step-by-step with any arithmetical
exactitude of only that much which is required in the thinking of a man in ordinary
times or under normal circumstances.278.
Mere use of abusive language does not give rise to private defence. Thus, where the
deceased about a month before the murder had tried to outrage the modesty of the
wife of the accused and thereafter on the day of the incident cut a rustic joke enquiring
whether the accused had not kept buffaloes for drinking milk which lead the accused
to beat the deceased mercilessly resulting in his death, it was held that giving the most
charitable interpretation one could not find a single circumstance which will give the
accused the benefit of the right of private defence and the interval between the attempt
to outrage the modesty of the accused's wife and the murder being too long he was
also not entitled to get the benefit of grave and sudden provocation within the meaning
of exception 1 to section 300, IPC, 1860.279. Giving a general view of all the provisions
on this right in Munney Khan v State,280. the Supreme Court observed:
The right of private defence is codified in sections 96 to 106, IPC, which have all to be
read together in order to have a proper grasp of the scope and limitations of this right.
By enacting the sections the authors of the Code wanted to except from the operation
of its penal clauses acts done in good faith for the purpose of repelling unlawful
aggression.281.
Summary of Principles regarding Private defence
(i) Self-preservation is the basic human instinct and is duly recognized by the
criminal jurisprudence of all civilized countries. All free, democratic and civilized
countries recognize the right of private defence within certain reasonable limits.
(ii) The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted
with the necessity of averting an impending danger and not of self-creation.
(iii) A mere reasonable apprehension is enough to put the right of self-defence into
operation. In other words, it is not necessary that there should be an actual
commission of the offence in order to give rise to the right of private defence. It
is enough if the accused apprehended that such an offence is contemplated
and it is likely to be committed if the right of private defence is not exercised.
(iv) The right of private defence commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension
arises and it is co-terminus with the duration of such apprehension.
(v) It is unrealistic to expect a person under assault to modulate his defence step by
step with any arithmetical exactitude.
(vi) In private defence the force used by the accused ought not to be wholly
disproportionate or much greater than necessary for protection of the person or
property.
(vii) It is well settled that even if the accused does not plead self-defence, it is open
to consider such a plea if the same arises from the material on record.
(viii) The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence
beyond reasonable doubt.
(ix) The IPC, 1860 confers the right of private defence only when that unlawful or
wrongful act is an offence.
(x) A person who is in imminent and reasonable danger of losing his life or limb
may in exercise of self-defence inflict any harm even extending to death on his
assailant either when the assault is attempted or directly threatened.
[Darshan Singh v State of Punjab.282.]
All the sections would have to be read together to ascertain whether in the facts and
circumstances of the case the accused were entitled to the defence or they exceeded
it. Only then one can get a comprehensive view of the scope and limitations of the
right.283.
1. Availability or Non-availability of private defence.—Factors to be kept in view.— In
order to find whether right of private defence is available or not, the entire incident
must be examined with care and viewed in its proper setting. The injuries received by
the accused, the imminence of threat to his safety, the injuries caused by the accused
and the circumstances whether the accused had time to have recourse to public
authorities are all relevant factors to be considered on a plea of private defence.284.
The right of private defence is a defence right. It is neither a right of aggression nor a
right of reprisal. There is no right of private defence where there is no apprehension of
danger. Right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted
with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. The necessity
must be a present necessity whether real or only apparent.285. It remains a question of
fact whether the right has been legitimately exercised.286. Thus, running to house,
fetching a sword and assaulting the deceased are by no means a matter of chance.
These acts bear stamp of a design to kill and take the case out of the purview of
private defence.287. But where the accused was dispossessed of his land by a party of
men and he ran to his residence from where he fetched his gun and came back within
15 minutes to fire at and injure them, he was held to be within his rights, but when he
went further still and chased and injured a person who was just standing by there and
who died, in reference to him the accused had no right of private defence.288. Along
with the above factors one has also to remember the following limitations on the right
of private defence of person or property:
(i) that if there is sufficient time for recourse to public authorities, the right are not
available;
(ii) that more harm than that is necessary should not be caused;
(iii) that there must be a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt or hurt
to the person or damage to the property concerned.289. Where on account of
some incident, the accused was confronted by three persons; it was held that
the superiority in numbers in itself could in all probability have been construed
by the accused as an imminent danger to himself thus, giving him the signal to
act in exercise of the right of private defence.290.
The need to act must not have been created by the conduct of the accused in the
immediate context of the incident which was likely or intended to give rise to that
need.291. The Supreme Court reiterated the various principles governing the law of
private defence and observed that it was essentially a defensive right and did not
include the right to launch an offensive attack, particularly when the need for defence
no longer existed.292. A right of private defence given by the Penal Code is essentially
one of defence or self-protection and not a right of reprisal or punishment. It is subject
to the restrictions indicated in section 99 which are as important as the right itself.293.
[s 96.4] CASES.—Plea of Private Defence rejected.—
After inflicting injuries on person of first deceased, accused persons ran towards
second deceased, who was standing ten steps away from place of incident. Further
after seeing incident relating to death of first deceased, second deceased started
running towards Durga-ki-Dhani and was chased by accused persons and they inflicted
lathi blows on his person. Accused had no right to invoke right of self-defence by
chasing second deceased and to cause fatal injuries upon him.294. Where the accused
were in fact the aggressors and being members of the aggressors party none of the
accused can claim right of self-defence.295. Merely because there was a quarrel and
some of the accused person sustained injuries, that does not confer a right of private
defence extending to the extent of causing death. It has to be established that the
accused person were under such grave apprehension about the safety of their life and
property that retaliation to the extent done was absolutely necessary. Right of private
defence has been rightly discarded.296.
The defence claimed that the place of occurrence was the house of the accused and,
therefore, they had acted in self-defence but that was not proved through any leading
evidence despite the examination of the accused under section 313 of the Cr PC, 1973,
it was held that the right of self-defence was not available to them.297.
[s 96.5] Social nature of defence.—
The right of private defence is not restricted to the particular person who is under
attack. It extends to the society as a whole. It is available to any member of the society
who rises to the occasion. But it is wholly a social obligation without any legal
overtones.298.
[s 96.6] Material that accused may rely on.—
An accused entitled to rely for constructing his private defence on the material on
record brought by the prosecution.299. Without formally taking a plea of self-defence,
the accused has a right to probabilise such defence on the basis of the prosecution
evidence and if he succeeds in his effort, the Court can give him such a benefit.300.
2. Duty to retreat, if any.—It is now well settled that the rule of retreat which Common
Law Courts espoused is not relevant under the IPC, 1860. If a man's property is in
imminent danger of being impaired or attacked he has the right to resort to such
measures as would be reasonably necessary to thwart the attempt to protect his
property.301. Under the common law the doctrine of necessity permitted one to defend
one's person or property or the person or property of others against an unjustified
attack by the use of reasonable force. In determining what was reasonable force, which
in the Indian context means minimum force under section 99, IPC, 1860, the common
law Courts always insisted if the accused could prevent the commission of crime
against him by retreating. On this rule of retreat one would like to ask: if a person is
attacked by an armed burglar in his own room, he is expected to run away leaving the
burglar to act as he liked.302. In Jaidev's case303. Gajendragadkar, J, as he then was,
specifically held that in India there is no rule which expects a man first to run away or at
least try to do so before he can exercise his right of private defence. Rather he has
every right to stand his own ground and defend himself if there is no time to have
recourse to official help. Law does not expect a citizen to be a rank coward or leave his
own house at the mercy of the burglar.304. In spite of this clear exposition of the law in
Jaidev's case Sarkaria, J, held in Yogendra Morarji's case305. that one must first try to
avoid the attack by retreating otherwise one would not be entitled to get the benefit of
private defence. It appears that Jaidev's case was not canvassed before the learned
judges who decided the latter case. It is submitted with utmost respect that the former
view as held in Jaidev's case, appears to be more reasonable and has to be preferred.
3. No Private defence in a free fight.—Where both sides can be convicted for their
individual acts, normally no right of private defence is available to either party and they
will be guilty of their respective acts.306. Where two parties come armed with
determination to measure their strength and to settle a dispute by force and in the
ensuing fight both sides receive injuries, no question of right of private defence arises.
In such a case of free fight both parties are aggressors and none of them can claim
right of private defence.307. In a free fight between two groups resulting in the death of
one and injuries to several others both grievous and simple, all the accused
participated in the fight. The plea of one of the accused that he joined the fight later
and acted in defence of other co-accused was held to be not tenable. The Court
observed that his case could not be separated by giving him right of private defence
under the benefit of doubt.308. In a sudden fight between two groups in heat of passion
death of a man was caused and several others on both the sides were injured. The
deceased opened the assault first. It was held that in such fights the question that
which party opened attack first is immaterial. Plea of right of self-defence was not
allowed to the accused.309. Where two groups forming an unlawful assembly over the
possession of land in dispute which was in peaceful possession of neither group,
indulged in free fight resulting in the death of two persons of a group, it was held that
right of private defence was not available to either group.310.
The right to voluntary causing of death or any other harm is available against the
assailant and not against any other person.311.
4. Injury to accused.—If makes out private defence.—Number of injuries on the
accused by itself may not be sufficient to establish the right of private defence.312. The
number of injuries is not always considered to be a safe criterion for determining who
the aggressor was. It can also not be laid down as an unqualified proposition of law
that whenever injuries are on the body of the accused person, the presumption must
necessarily be raised that the accused person had caused injuries in exercise of the
right of private defence. The defence has to further establish that the injury so caused
on the accused probabilise the version of the right of private defence.313. Non-
explanation of injuries on the person of the accused is a factor of great importance and
this fact may induce the Court in judging the veracity of prosecution witnesses with
considerable care.314. The right of private defence cannot justifiably be raised by
showing that one of the accused had suffered some minor injuries and the prosecution
had not explained the same.315. In a given case it may strengthen the plea of private
defence set up by the accused or may create genuine doubt regarding the prosecution
case. At the same time it cannot be laid down as an invariable proposition of law that
as soon as it is found that the accused had received injuries in the same transaction in
which the complainant party was assaulted, the plea of private defence would stand
prima facie established and burden would shift on to the prosecution to prove that
those injuries were caused to the accused in self-defence by the complainant party.316.
When the accused turned back from the house of the deceased whom they had visited,
the deceased followed them along with his brother and mother and tried to attack them
from behind. The accused turned back and shot at him causing death. It was held that
the conduct of the accused was justifiable. His acquittal was not interfered with.317.
Where the deceased along with his father was putting up a fence which was protested
by the accused resulting in an altercation, and the accused suddenly dealt a lathi blow
on the head of the deceased which proved fatal, it was held that since the accused
received injuries as a result of assault by the deceased and his father, the accused had
justifiably exercised his right of private defence.318. In a case of murder some of the
serious injuries found on the person of the accused were not explained and some of
the prosecution witnesses also were injured, it was held that it could be said that the
accused party had acted in exercise of right of private defence and confirmation of the
acquittal of all the accused but one by the High Court was not proper.319. Where
serious injuries inflicted on the person of the accused could not be explained by the
prosecution, the accused could be said to be entitled to the right of private defence.
Their conviction under section 300 was held to be not proper.320.
In State of UP v Mukunde,321. the Supreme Court observed that merely on the ground
that the prosecution witnesses have not explained the injuries on the accused, their
evidence ought not to be rejected if the Court finds it probable that the accused might
have acted in exercise of the right of private defence. The Supreme Court also
observed in a subsequent case322. that:
it cannot be held as a matter of law or invariably a rule that whenever an accused sustained
an injury in the same occurrence the prosecution is obliged to explain the injury and on the
failure of the prosecution to do so, the prosecution case should be disbelieved. Before non-
explanation of injuries on the person of the accused by the prosecution witnesses may
affect the prosecution case, the court has to be satisfied of the existence of two conditions:
(1) that the injuries on the person of the accused were of a serious nature and (ii) such
injuries must have been received at the time of the occurrence in question. Non-explanation
of injuries assumes greater significance when the evidence consists of interested or
partisan witnesses or where the defence gives a version which completes in probability with
that of the prosecution.323.
These rulings were followed in Kashi Ram v State of MP324. The accused persons were
alleged to have assaulted the prosecution party, but the prosecution witnesses failed to
explain serious injuries including injuries on the vital parts of the body sustained by one
of the accused in the same incident. The Court said that this could not be a ground for
discarding the prosecution story and for acquittal of all accused persons.
Where the accused had some trivial injuries on non-vital parts but the victim had
suffered as many as 19 injuries including some on vital parts which resulted in his
death, it could not be believed that the accused had acted in self-defence especially
when he was arrested five or six days after the incident but in the intervening time did
not care to get himself medically examined. A plea of private defence cannot be based
on surmises and speculation.325.
The Supreme Court has also observed that merely because there was a quarrel and the
accused persons also sustained injuries, it did not confer a right of private defence to
the extent of causing death. Though such right cannot be weighed in golden scales, it
has at least to be shown that the accused persons were under such grave
apprehension about the safety of their life and property and that the retaliation to the
extent actually done was absolutely necessary.326.
The number of injuries is not always a safe criterion for determining as to who was the
aggressor. It cannot be stated as a universal rule that whenever injuries are on the body
of the accused person, a presumption must necessarily be raised that the accused
persons had caused injuries in the exercise of the right of private defence. The defence
has further to show that injuries on the accused probabilise the version of the right of
private defence.327. In moments of excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium,
parties cannot be expected to preserve composure and use exactly only so much in
retaliation as is commensurate with the apprehended danger. Due weightage has to be
given to what happened at the spur of the moment at the spot. Things have to be
judged pragmatically keeping in view, the normal human reactions and behaviour, self-
preservation being the paramount consideration. Microscopic and pedantic scrutiny
has to be avoided.328.
[s 96.7] Retaliation.—
The Supreme Court observed:
From a plain reading of the sections (Ss. 96–106) it is manifest that such a right can be
exercised only to repel unlawful aggression and not to retaliate. To put it differently, the right
is one of defence and not of requital or reprisal. Such being the nature of the right, the High
Court could not have exonerated the accused persons of the charges levelled against them
by bestowing on them the right to retaliate and attack the complainant party.329.
[s 96.8] Where private defence not pleaded.—
If circumstances show that the right of private defence was legitimately exercised, it is
open to the Court to consider such a plea, even if accused had not taken it. A right of
private defence need not specifically be taken and in the event the Court on the basis of
the materials placed on record is in a position to come to such a conclusion, the Court
may act thereupon.330. Where the right of private defence was not pleaded by the
accused, but it appeared that the complainant was the aggressor, the Bombay High
Court held that the benefit of such defence could still be given to the accused.331. Fact
that accused pleaded alibi-itself will not preclude the Court from giving him also the
right of private defence if on proper appraisal of evidence and other material on
records, Court finds it to be available to him.332. The right of private defence cannot be
denied merely because the accused adopted a different line of defence particularly
when the evidence adduced by the prosecution would indicate that they were put under
a situation where they could reasonably have apprehended grievous hurt even to one of
them.333. The Supreme Court endorsed this principle by saying that it is not necessary
that the plea of private defence must always be taken by the accused person. Even if
the accused does not do so, the Court can consider it if the circumstances show that
the right of private defence was legitimately exercised.334.
The accused has not to plead self-defence by examining some witnesses or by making
any statement. But there has to be some material available on record to indicate that
the accused had attacked the deceased in exercise of the right of self-defence.335.
[s 96.9] In appeal.—
It is permissible for accused to raise that plea at the stage of appeal as the settled
legal position is that even if the accused does not plead self-defence, it is open to
consider such a plea if the same arises from the material on record.336.
