prosecutrix fell prey to persons dealing in flesh trade. Passing through several hands she was
ultimately purchased by the accused. The fact that she had given consent at the starting point

accused. Her testimony was considered to be fully reliable for the purpose of convicting the
accused. Shiv Nath v State of MP, 1998 Cr LJ 2691 (MP), statements and letters to the accused
of the prosecutrix showed her consent. No conviction.
