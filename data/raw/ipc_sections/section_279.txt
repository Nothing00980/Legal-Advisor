COMMENT.—
The offence constituted by this section does not involve the idea of any adulteration or
inferiority in the substituted medicine. It is sufficient that it is not in fact what it
purports to be; for e.g., supplying savin instead of saffron.26.
This section is connected with section 275 in the same way as section 274 is
connected with section 273.
[s 276.1] Possession as evidence of intention.—
Dealing with an Act for prevention of drug trafficking, the Privy Council observed in a
case in which the accused was found in possession of the banned drug and there was
nothing in the Act to exclude the common law rule that facts could be established by
inference from proven facts; therefore, the judge had applied the appropriate standard
of proof. The accused had given no evidence to explain his possession.27.
For local amendment, see Comment under section 272 ante.
