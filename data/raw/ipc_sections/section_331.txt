Causing hurt by means of poison, etc., with intent to commit an
offence.
Whoever administers to or causes to be taken by any person any poison or any
stupefying, intoxicating or unwholesome drug, or other thing with intent to cause hurt
to such person, or with intent to commit or to facilitate the commission of an offence
or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause hurt, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.—
The offence under this section is complete even if no hurt is caused to the person to
whom the poison or any other stupefying, intoxicating, or unwholesome drug is
administered. This section is merely an extension of the provisions of section 324.
Under section 324 actual causing of hurt is essential: under this section mere
administration of poison is sufficient to bring the offender to justice. In order to prove
an offence under section 328 the prosecution is required to prove that the substance in
question was a poison, or any stupefying, intoxicating or unwholesome drug, etc., and
that the accused administered the substance to the complainant or caused the
complainant to take such substance and further that he did so with intent to cause hurt
or knowing it to be likely that he would thereby cause hurt, or with the intention to
commit or facilitate the commission of an offence. It is, therefore, essential for the
prosecution to prove that the accused was directly responsible for administering
poison, etc., or causing it to be taken by any person, through another. In other words,
the accused may accomplish the act by himself or by means of another. In either
situation direct, reliable and cogent evidence is necessary.850.
[s 328.1] Section 328 and section 376.—
Accused offered the complainant/prosecutrix a cold drink (Pepsi) allegedly containing
a poisonous/intoxicating substance. According to the complainant/prosecutrix she felt
inebriated after taking the cold drink. In her aforesaid state, the appellant-accused
started misbehaving with her. There were no scientific materials to prove the
allegations and hence the proceedings were held liable to be quashed.851.
[s 328.2] Causing unwholesome thing to be taken.—
Where the accused mixed milk-bush juice in his toddy pots, knowing that if drunk by a
person it would cause injury, with the intention of detecting an unknown thief who was
always in the habit of stealing his toddy, and the toddy was drunk by some soldiers who
purchased it from an unknown vendor, it was held that he was guilty under this
section.852.
[s 328.3] Hooch tragedies.—
Prosecution case is that 70 persons died after having consumed liquor from the shops
and sub-shops which were catered by the firm named "Bee Vee Liquors" and 24 lost
eyesights permanently, not to speak of many others who became prey of lesser
injuries. It was the liquor supplied by the firm to the shops and sub-shops which was
consumed; and so, it has to be held that the consumers were made to take the liquor
supplied by the firm. On facts, the requirements of section 328 being present, the
conviction under section 328 was held rightful.853.
[s 328.4] Charge under section 304, Conviction under section 328.—
The charge under section 304 framed against the appellant was with definite allegation
of culpable homicide not amounting to murder by reason of administration of drug
without taking precaution for reaction there from. This is totally different from causing
hurt by means of administration of unwholesome drug. On no count a definite charge
of culpable homicide can be an error for causing hurt. Going by section 214 Cr PC,
1973 in every charge words used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have
been used in the sense attached to them by law under which such offence is
punishable. Therefore, to construe the section relating to culpable homicide as only an
error for causing hurt by unwholesome drug will lead to be misleading so far as the
accused is concerned resulting in failure of justice so far as his opportunity to defend
is concerned.854.
