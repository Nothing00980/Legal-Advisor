Enticing or taking away or detaining with criminal intent a married
woman.
Whoever takes or entices away any woman who is and whom he knows or has reason
to believe to be the wife of any other man, from that man, or from any person having
the care of her on behalf of that man, with intent that she may have illicit intercourse
with any person, or conceals or detains with that intent any such woman, 1 shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two
years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
Under section 498, IPC, 1860 enticing or taking away a married woman with criminal
intent is an offence. Entering or taking away somebody's wife for the purpose other
than mentioned in section 498, IPC, 1860 does not constitute an offence. Therefore, in
order to bring home guilt of a person under section 498, IPC, 1860, the prosecution has
to prove that a married woman was enticed or taken away with an intention that she
might have illicit intercourse with any person.47.
Sections 361 and 366 may be compared with this section, which may come into
operation when the two former sections fail to apply, but only in respect of a married
woman. This and the preceding sections are evidently intended for the protection of
husbands, who alone can institute prosecutions for offences under them.
The gist of the offence under this section appears to be the deprivation of the husband
of his custody and his proper control over his wife with the object of having illicit
intercourse with her.48.
[s 498.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires three things:—
1. Taking or enticing away or concealing or detaining the wife of another man from that
man or from any person having the care of her on behalf of that man.
2. Such taking, enticing, concealing or detaining, must be with intent that she may have
illicit intercourse with any person.
3. Knowledge or reason to believe that the woman is the wife of another man.
[s 498.2] Sections 366 and 498.—
A comparison of the ingredients constituting an offence under sections 366 and 498
shows that though there are some ingredients which are common, but the ingredients
for the offence under section 498 constitute of some of the very important particulars
which are not in an offence under section 366, IPC, 1860. The additional ingredients of
section 498, IPC, 1860 namely, (i) that the woman said to have been taken away is the
married wife of another man, and (ii) that the accused has taken her away with the
knowledge that she is the wife of that person are not at all in the offence under section
366, IPC, 1860. Therefore, the offence under section 498 cannot be said to be a minor
offence or an offence under section 366 within the meaning of the term used in section
222(2) of the Cr PC, 1973.49.
1. 'Detains with that intent any such woman'.—The word "detains" means "keeps back".
The keeping back need not necessarily be by physical force, it may be by persuasion or
by allurement and blandishment. The use of the word requires that there should be
something in the nature of control or influence which can properly be described as a
keeping back of the woman. To constitute detention proof of some kind of persuasion
is necessary. It cannot properly be said that a man detains a woman if she has no
desire to leave and on the contrary wishes to stay with him.50. The Supreme Court has
held that the keeping back may be by force, but it need not be by force. It can be the
result of persuasion, allurement or blandishment, which may either have caused the
willingness of the woman, or may have encouraged, or co-operated with, her initial
inclination to leave her husband.51.

the main ingredient is enticing away married woman from her husband. Criminal intent on the
part of the accused has to be proved. The consequence of not examining the material witness,
the wife, led to acquittal of accused. No interference.
