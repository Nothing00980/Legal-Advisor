COMMENT—
Section 410 defines stolen property. A property is stolen for the purpose of this section
when its possession is transferred by theft, extortion, robbery, dacoity or criminal
breach of trust or which was obtained under misappropriation committed whether in
India or outside. An extended meaning is given to the words 'stolen property' which are
used in the four subsequent sections. Not only things which have been stolen, extorted
or robbed but also things which have been obtained by criminal misappropriation or
criminal breach of trust are within the meaning assigned to these words. Section 411
provides punishment to the person who dishonestly receives stolen property. The
person must have the knowledge that it is a stolen property. This section as also the
succeeding sections are directed not against the principal offender, e.g., a thief, robber
or misappropriator but against the class of persons who trade in stolen articles and are
receivers of stolen property. Principal offenders are therefore, outside the scope of this
section. Accordingly the conviction of the principal offender is also not a prerequisite to
the conviction of the receiver of stolen property under this section.444.
[s 411.1] Essential ingredients.—
(a) Dishonest receipt or retention of stolen property. (b) Knowledge or reason to believe
at the time of receipt that the property was obtained in the ways specified in the
section. The offence of dishonest retention of property is almost contemporaneous
with the offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property. A person who dishonestly
receives property and retains it, must obviously continue to retain it. It is the duty of the
prosecution in order to bring home the guilt of a person under section 411 to prove:
(1) That the stolen property was in the possession of the accused.
(2) That some person other than the accused had possession of the property
before the accused got possession of it and
(3) That the accused had knowledge that the property was stolen.445. When the field
from which the ornaments were recovered was an open one, and accessible to all and
sundry, it is difficult to hold positively that the accused was is possession of these
articles. The fact of recovery by the accused is compatible with the circumstance of
somebody else having placed the articles there and of the accused somehow acquiring
knowledge about their whereabouts and that being so, the fact of discovery cannot be
regarded as conclusive proof that the accused was in possession of these articles.446.
As observed by the Apex Court in the case of N Madhavan v State of Kerala,447. as a
normal rule after an inquiry or trial when the accused is discharged or acquitted the
Court ought to restore the property from the person from whose custody it was taken
and in a case of conviction, it is the person from whose possession it was stolen, who
would be entitled to its possession when the property seized is referable to such stolen
property.
1. 'Dishonestly receives or retains'.— To constitute dishonest retention, there must
have been a change in the mental element of possession,—possession always
subsisting animo et facto—from an honest to a dishonest condition of the mind in
relation to the thing possessed. Where pursuant to a hire purchase agreement, on the
default of the purchaser to pay the instalment amount, the seller of a vehicle
repossessed it, it was held that as there was no dishonest intention to retain on his
part, the provisions of this section were not attracted.448.
[s 411.2] Identity of stolen property.—
Before a conviction can be recorded under this section it must be shown that the
property recovered and seized was stolen property. Where, therefore, the identity of the
property is not established, there cannot be any conviction under section 411, IPC,
1860.449.
2. 'Knowing or having reason to believe the same to be stolen property'.—The offence
made punishable is not the receiving of stolen property from any particular person, but
receiving such property knowing it to be stolen. The word 'believe' is a much stronger
word than suspect, and it involves the necessity of showing that the circumstances
were such that a reasonable man must have felt convinced in his mind that the
property with which he was dealing must be stolen property.450.
[s 411.3] Stolen property of the deceased.—
Where stolen ornaments of the deceased which she had been wearing when she was
last seen alive are discovered within three days of the murder in pursuance of an
information given by the accused and there is no other evidence, the accused can be
convicted only under section 411 and not under section 302, IPC, 1860, or section 394,
IPC, 1860, as there is nothing to connect him with the murder or the robbery.451.
[s 411.4] Recent Possession.—
There is a presumption under the law that where a person is found to be in a recent
possession of stolen or robbed articles, he must be the offender himself or must have
received them with knowledge. In reference to the meaning of the expression "recent
possession", the Supreme Court has suggested that no fixed time limit can be laid
down and each matter must go by its own facts. It varies according to whether the
property in question in its nature is capable of passing readily from hand to hand. If the
goods are not of that kind, even one year may not be too long. In the present case,
however, there was no gap of time between the arrest of the accused and the recovery
and, hence, the presumption of his guilt.452.
[s 411.5] Sentencing.—
Where the period of 12 years had elapsed since the institution of the case and the
accused (revision petitioner) remained in jail for ten months, his sentence was reduced
to the period already undergone. The Court did not interfere in the concurrent finding of
fact.453.
[s 411.6] Presumption from possession.—
A property which was alleged to have been taken by robbery at the point of pistol was
found in the possession of the accused. While the charge of robbery under section 392
failed, that of receiving stolen property became established by reason of the
presumption created by section 114 of the Evidence Act, 1872.454. When the
prosecution established beyond all reasonable doubt that M.O s. 25–27 belonged to
the deceased No. 1, were found in the possession of A2, the burden shifts to the
accused to explain the same under section 114-A of the Evidence Act. If he has not
explained the possession of stolen articles, the presumption is that he is receiver of
stolen property or a thief.455.
[s 411.7] Probation.—
The accused was under 21 years of age; has five brothers and sisters; is son of a poor
agriculturist and that the stolen articles recovered from him are not so valuable, the
sentence of imprisonment imposed by the learned appellate Court is set aside and the
petitioner is directed to be released on probation of good conduct for a period of six
months.456.
