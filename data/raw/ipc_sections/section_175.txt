COMMENT.—
Absconding to avoid summons.—Absconding to avoid service of summons or other
proceeding is similar to non-attendance in obedience to an order from a public servant.
The object of this section is to punish an offender for the contempt his conduct
indicates of the authority whose process he disregards.
The second clause applies where the summons or notice or order is (1) for attendance
in Court; or (2) for production of a document.
1. 'Absconds'.—This term is not to be understood as implying necessarily that a person
leaves the place in which he is. Its etymological and ordinary sense is to hide oneself;
and it matters not whether a person departs from a place or remains in it, if he
conceals himself. If a person, having concealed himself before process issues,
continues to do so after it is issued, he absconds.2.
2. 'Summons, notice or order'.—The summons, notice or order referred to, should be
addressed to the same person whose attendance is required and who absconds to
avoid being served with such a 'summons, notice or order'. A warrant is not an order
served on an accused; it is simply an order to the police to arrest him.3. It is not an
offence under this section to abscond to avoid arrest under a warrant.4.
[s 172.1] Bar to take Cognizance:
As per section 195(1)(a)(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, (Cr PC, 1973) No
court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under S. 172 to 188 (both
inclusive) of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860, except on the complaint in writing of
'the public servant concerned' or of some other public servant to whom he is
administratively subordinate. When the Court in its discretion is disinclined to
prosecute the wrongdoers, no private complainant can be allowed to initiate any
criminal proceeding in his individual capacity as it would be clear from the reading of
the section itself which is to the effect that no Court can take cognizance of any
offence punishable under sections 172–188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC, 1860)
except on the written complaint of 'the public servant concerned' or of some other
public servant to whom he is administratively subordinate.5.
