Attempt to commit culpable homicide.
Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge and under such
circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of culpable
homicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both; and,
if hurt is caused to any person by such act, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with
both.
ILLUSTRATION
A, on grave and sudden provocation, fires a pistol at Z, under such circumstances that
if he thereby caused death he would be guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to
murder. A has committed the offence defined in this section.
COMMENT.—
The wording of this section is the same as that of the preceding one except that it
deals with an attempt to commit culpable homicide. The punishment provided is,
therefore, not so severe. Before an accused can be held to be guilty under section 308
IPC, 1860 it was necessary to arrive at a finding that the ingredients thereof, namely,
requisite intention or knowledge was existing.656. When the accused can be attributed
only knowledge that by inflicting such injuries he was likely to cause death and an
attempt to commit such an offence would be one punishable under section 308 IPC,
1860.657.
[s 308.1] Nature of injury.—
Whether the injury was grievous or simple deserved a back seat in face of the charge
under section 308/34 IPC, 1860. Offence punishable under section 308 IPC, 1860
postulates doing of an act with such intention or knowledge and under such
circumstances that if one by that act caused death, he would be guilty of culpable
homicide not amounting to murder. An attempt of that nature may actually result in
hurt or may not. It is the attempt to commit culpable homicide which is punishable
under section 308 IPC, 1860 whereas punishment for simple hurts can be meted out
under sections 323 and 324 and for grievous hurts under sections 325 and 326 IPC,
1860. Qualitatively, these offences are different.658.
[s 308.2] Self-defence.—
Merely because the prosecution witnesses had suffered more injuries than the
respondents, would not be sufficient to hold that the respondents were the aggressor
party. In other words, the defence version cannot be discarded only on the basis of
lesser number of injuries having been suffered by them. Appeal against acquittal
dismissed.659. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Supreme Court
found that plea of self-defence was not made out by the appellant and, therefore,
contention that the finding recorded by the High Court that he was guilty under section
304, Part-I IPC, 1860 for causing death of the deceased and under section 308, IPC,
1860 for causing injuries to Rahmat should be sustained cannot be accepted.660.
[s 308.3] Sentence.—
Trial Court convicted accused under section 308 r/w 149 and sentenced them to three
years RI and fine of Rs. 500 each. The High Court confirmed the conviction and
sentence. The Supreme Court modified the sentence by reducing the imprisonment to
one year and increased the fine amount to Rs. 25,000.661. Accused was convicted
under section 308, IPC, 1860. Offence was committed when the accused was 17 years
old. High Court released him under section 4 of Probation of Offenders Act, 1958.662.
