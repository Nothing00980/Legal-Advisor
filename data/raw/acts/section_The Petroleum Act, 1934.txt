The Petroleum Act, 1934
(30 OF 1934)
19.
 


/854
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The Indian Petroleum Act, 1899, was passed at the time when the use of petroleum, particularly of dangerous petroleum or petrol, was limited, and with the great developments in the use of petroleum that have taken place in the last 30 years it has become unsuitable in several ways. As early as 1903, the attention of the Government of India was drawn to the inconvenience arising from the existence in different Provinces of separate sets of rules to regulate the importation, possession and transport of petroleum. The present Act does not permit the issue by the Government of India of a set of rules applicable throughout British India and the only way in which it has been possible to secure unformity has been made by the issue by Local Governments from time to time of similar rules with the sanction of the Central Government. Local Governments and the interests concerned were consulted on the subject of revising the Act in 1925-26, and it was agreed by all Local Governments that the rule-making power should be transferred to the Central Government. In addition a number of other changes have been proposed in the light of experience.
The opportunity has been taken to rearrange the whole law. In addition to the "Preliminary" portion and the final "Supplemental" Chapter the Bill contains three separate Chapters. Chapter I relates to the control of petroleum and Chapter II to its testing, while Chapter III contains the necessary penal provisions and what may be described as criminal procedure.
Amendment Act 31 of 1977-Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The Committee on Subordinate Legislation (Fifth Lok Sabha) in their Fourteenth Report desired that the Government should undertake a review of all Acts to find out which of them do not contain a provision for laying of rules framed thereunder before the Parliament and should incorporate such a provision in those Acts. As the Petroleum Act, 1934, does not contain such a provision, the Bill seeks to include such a provision in that Act.
2. The opportunity is availed of to change the reference to the Chief Inspector of Explosives in India and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, into references to the Chief Controller of Explosives and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, respectively.
[6th September, 1934]
An Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to the import, transport, storage, production, refining and blending of petroleum [* * *] 
[ The words " and other inflammable substances"  omitted by Act 24 of 1970, Section 2 (w.e.f. 1.8.1976).]
.
Whereas it is expedient to consolidate and amend the law relating to the import, transport, storage, production, refining and blending of petroleum [* * *] 
[ The words " and other inflammable substances"  omitted by Act 24 of 1970, Section 2 (w.e.f. 1.8.1976).]
; It is hereby enacted as follows:-


This Act was extended to Berar by the Petroleum (Berar Extension) Act 23 of 1937. All rules made and notifications issued under this Act and in force in British India at the commencement of Act 23 of 1937 (w.e.f. 7.10.1937) were also extended to Berar by Section 3 of the latter Act.
This Act has been extended to the new Provinces and Merged States by the Merged States (Laws) Act 59 of 1949 and to the States of Manipur, Tripura and Vindhya Pradesh by the Union Territories (Laws) Act 30 of 1950. Manipur and Tripura are full-fledged States now, see Act 81 of 1971. Vindhya Pradesh has merged with Madhya Pradesh State, see Act 
37 of 1956
.
It has also been extended to the State of Jammu and Kashmir by Act 62 of 1956.
It has now been extended to be the Union Territory of (1) Goa, Daman and Diu by Regulation 12 of 1962. Goa is now a State, see Act 18 of 1987; (2) Dadra and Nagar Haveli by Regulation 6 of 1963; (3) Pondicherry by Regulation 7 of 1963 and (4) Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Island by Regulation 8 of 1965.
