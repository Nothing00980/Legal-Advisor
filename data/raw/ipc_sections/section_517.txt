STATE AMENDMENTS
Uttar Pradesh.—The following amendments were made by Notification No. 777/VIII 9-
4(2)-87, dated 31-7-1989, published in U.P. Gazette, Extra, Part-4, Section (Kha) dated 2-8-
1989.
"Any offence punishable under section 506, (IPC, 1860), when committed in any district
of Uttar Pradesh, shall be notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973) be cognizable and non-bailable."
Andhra Pradesh.—In Andhra Pradesh the offence is non-bailable if committed in A.P. vide
G.O. Ms. No. 732, dated 5-12-1991.
COMMENT.—
Where a person entered the victim's house during midnight armed with a knife and
threatened with death anyone who came between himself and the victim, the offence
under this section was held to have been made out.32. The threat must be real in the
sense that the accused means what he says and the victim of the threat should feel
threatened actually.33. Where the accused made his outburst on a public servant when
he was on the way to attend his office saying that he was going to kill him, it was held
that it was sufficient to hold that the act will fall under section 506.34.
[s 506.1] Mere words.—
In order to attract the ingredients of section 506, (IPC, 1860) the intention of the
accused must be to cause alarm to the victim. Mere expression of words, without any
intention to cause alarm, would not suffice.35. In Amulya Kumar Behera v Nabaghana
Behera,36. it was held that intention of the accused must be to cause alarm to the
victim and whether he is alarmed or not is of no consequence. However, mere
expression of any words without any intention to cause alarm would not be sufficient to
bring in the application of section 506.
In absence of basic ingredients of the section in the complaint, no case under section
506 (IPC, 1860) can be sustained.37. Where all the witnesses have stated in specific
terms that the accused came prepared and intimidated the complainant and also other
witnesses. All the respondents are liable to be convicted for the offence punishable
under section 506 of the (IPC, 1860).38.
Where it was found that that the accused issued no threats to the complainant so as to
cause death or grievous hurt, it was held that mere exhortation to his co-accused to
finish him, did not amount to threat. His conviction under section 506 was set aside.39.
Asking a person not to work in a private garden and threatening him to go away form
the garden would not satisfy the requirements of the section.40.
The statements said to have been made against accused six months prior to the death
of the deceased with regard to the offence under section 506. (IPC, 1860) cannot be
treated as admissible under section 32(1) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.41.
[s 506.2] Part-I Non-cognizable.—
Since the part 1 of section 506 is not cognizable, the permission of the Magistrate
would be required to try the applicants under said section.42.
