Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means.
Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt by
means of any instrument for shooting, stabbing or cutting, or any instrument which,
used as weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, or by means of fire or any heated
substance, or by means of any poison or any corrosive substance, or by means of any
explosive substance or by means of any substance which it is deleterious to the
human body to inhale, to swallow, or to receive into the blood, or by means of any
animal, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This section makes simple hurt more grave, and liable to more severe punishment
where it has the differentia of one of the modes of infliction described in the
section.765.
[s 324.1] CASES.—
Where the accused gave a blow on the left side of the head of the victim with a Farsha,
a sharp-cutting weapon, causing a simple scalp-deep injury and there was the
possibility that the sharp edge of the weapon was not used, it was held that his
conviction should be changed from section 307 to one under section 324 IPC, 1860
since Farsha is a weapon which if used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause
death.766. Where a head injury was caused with a deadly weapon and the injured was
discharged from the hospital after 15 days, but six months thereafter he had to be
hospitalised again for brain operation and he did not recover, the death being not solely
due to the injury, the accused persons convicted under this section and their conviction
under section 304 was set aside.767. Tooth is an instrument of cutting and as such
biting off the tip of the nose would be an offence under this section or section 326 IPC,
1860 depending on the nature of the injury, simple or grievous.768. Where there is no
serious injury on any vital part of the body of the victim, the offender should be
convicted under section 324 and not under section 326 IPC, 1860.769. Thus, where the
accused inflicted an injury on the right shoulder of the deceased with a broken soda
water bottle with sharp edges without knowing that the deceased was suffering from
haemophilia (tendency of excessive bleeding), it was held that the accused was liable
only under section 324 and not under section 302 IPC, 1860.770. Where simple injuries
not likely to cause death were inflicted with a sword, the Supreme Court transferred the
conviction from under section 307 to one under this section and allowed the offences
to be compounded on payment to the victim a sum of Rs. 3,000.771. Where in a case of
a dowry death, the evidence showed that the accused, mother-in-law caused injuries on
the person of the daughter-in-law. She committed suicide. The accused was punished
under section 324 but on consideration of circumstances and facts that she was 80,
only a sentence of fine of Rs. 3,000 was imposed. Offence under section 306 was not
made out.772. Where the accused, a boy of 18 years of age at the time of incident
having no criminal history, in a sudden scuffle gave a blow on the chest of the
deceased with an ordinary knife resulting in his death and thereafter, mutely allowed to
take the knife from his hand and went to the hospital along with the deceased, it was
held that he had no intention to cause death or grievous hurt to the deceased, and was
guilty under section 324 and not under section 304, Part II.773. Where the accused
assaulted his victim by 'Katti' blow causing grievous hurt and the co-accused assaulted
the victim only by lathis and hands causing minor injuries and no pre-concert between
the accused and the co-accused regarding the assault by the 'Katti' was established, it
was held that the co-accused could not be vicariously held liable for the acts of the
accused and be convicted under section 324.774. Where a blow was inflicted with the
blunt side of the axe on the thigh of the victim, the Supreme Court reduced the
sentence to four months' RI and increased the fine to Rs. 3,000.775. Where the accused
deliberately attacked and killed a person with a deadly weapon and was held to be
rightly convicted for murder under section 300, he was convicted under this section
and sentenced to pay a fine for causing hurt on the hand of the intervening wife of the
deceased with a rice pounder.776.
In a free fight between two groups resulting in death of one person and injuries to
several others, fatal injury could not be attributed to any one of the accused who also
received a number of injuries. It was held that the accused were properly convicted
under sections 324 and 325.777. Where one of the accused caused two gunshot
injuries to a man which proved fatal, the other accused caused him only an incised
injury. The accused causing fatal injuries was sentenced under section 302 and the
other accused only under section 324.778. In an altercation the accused dealt a blow
with spade lying on the spot on the head of a 70-year-old man who became
unconscious, was hospitalised and died after three weeks. The blow caused only linear
fracture of left frontal bone. It was found that essential element of voluntarily causing
grievous hurt was wanting. It was held that his offence fell under section 324 and not
under section 326.779. Allegation that accused resorted to repeated firings at two
persons on two occasions at two different times and place. On first occasion accused
fired in air and pellets after being ricocheted from ceiling caused simple injuries to
three persons. On second occasion also appellant had not caused any injury to
anybody. In view of dearth of convincing evidence on record, it cannot be concluded
with any degree of certainty that appellant had an intention to commit murder of
anybody. Only conclusion could be drawn is that appellant wanted to cause hurt for
dispersing crowd. Appellant can only be convicted under section 324 of IPC, 1860 and
not under section 307 IPC, 1860.780. Medical evidence that injuries, however, serious in
nature but not grievous in nature. Skin grafting has been done and victim is fit for
discharge — Accused is guilty of offence under section 324 IPC, 1860 and not under
section 307 IPC, 1860.781. The accused struck his wife once only on the neck causing
simple injury. She fell down and was further injured and died. The instrument (wooden
reaper) was dangerous. The conviction was altered from under section 304, Part II to
section 324.782.
[s 324.2] Sections 324/149.—
Prosecution failed to prove that appellants had made unlawful assembly and caused
incised wound to complainant in furtherance of common object. Accused who
assaulted the complainant liable to be convicted under section 324 IPC, 1860 and other
accused persons liable to be convicted under section 323 of IPC, 1860.783.
[s 324.3] Acquittal.—
The essential ingredients to make out an offence under section 324 IPC, 1860 should
be that there must be voluntarily causing hurt and also the required intention. In other
words, to constitute an offence of voluntarily causing hurt, there must be complete
correspondence between the result and the intention or the knowledge of the person
who causes the said hurt.784. Where the injured witness himself attributed the injury on
him to the deceased, instead of the accused, the conviction of the accused on the
charge of section 324 cannot be sustained under law.785. Where no explanation by
prosecution as to how the injuries were caused to deceased and the role attributed to
appellants by prosecution is fully covered by their right of private defence, conviction
and sentence is liable to be set aside.786. In a case, the allegation was that the accused
petitioner inflicted simple and grievous injuries with sharp-edged weapon on person of
victim. The Injury Report was not proved and the doctor who signed it was not called
for examination. The Petitioner was held entitled to acquittal.787.
[s 324.4] Punishment.—
Where injuries were caused on account of quarrel over land and the incident was
already 17 years old, the accused was sentenced to two years RI and fine.788. Incident
had occurred more than 35 years ago. There was no complaint against appellant during
pendency of appeal of indulging into any criminal activities. Period of imprisonment
already undergone by appellant with fine of Rs. 10,000 and in default thereof to
undergo six months simple imprisonment would meet ends of justice.789.
[s 324.5] Non-Compoundable.—
Before the Code of the Criminal Procedure (Amendment Act) 2005 came into force,
offence under section 324 of IPC, 1860 was compoundable with the permission of the
Court as prescribed in the table, under sub-section (2) of section 320 of Cr PC, 1973.
The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment Act) 2005 (Act 25 of 2005) has taken out
section 324 of IPC, 1860 from the sphere of compounding and thereby made it non-
compoundable. Since the offence committed under section 324 of IPC, 1860 before
Amendment Act came into force, was compoundable with the permission of the Court
pursuant to the provisions prescribed under sub-section (2) of section 320 of Cr PC,
1973—as was in force before the Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Act 2005
came into effect.790. After coming into force of the Code of Criminal Procedure
(Amendment) Act 2005 the offence under section 324, IPC is made non-
compoundable. However, in this case the offence under section 324, IPC was
committed on 23 July 1986 on which date it was compoundable with the permission of
the Court. As the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment Act) 2005 is not applicable
to the facts of the case, the offence under section 324, IPC, 1860 would be
compoundable with the permission of the Court.791.
[s 324.6] Probation.—
Accused is convicted under section 324 IPC, 1860. Taking into consideration the 20
years age of one of the appellants on date of incident, benefit of Probation of Offenders
Act, 1958, is extended to him.792.
