Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different
intention from that of abettor.
Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act
with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the
punishment provided for the offence which would have been committed if the act had
been done with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other.
COMMENTS.â€”
This section provides that though the person abetted commits the offence with a
different intention or knowledge yet the abettor will be punished with the punishment
provided for the offence abetted. The liability of the person abetted is not affected by
this section.
Explanation 3 to section 108 should be read in conjunction with this section. See
