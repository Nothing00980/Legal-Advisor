COMMENT.—
Death caused in defence of property.—Section 100 enumerates the cases in which the
right of private defence of the body extends to the causing of death; this section
enumerates the cases in which it extends to the causing of death in defence of
property.
A person employed to guard the property of his employer is protected by sections 97,
99, 103 and 105 if he causes death in safeguarding his employer's property when there
is reason to apprehend that the person whose death has been caused was about to
commit one of the offences mentioned in this section or to attempt to commit one of
those offences. A person whose duty it is to guard a public building is in the same
position, that is to say, it is his duty to protect the property of his employer and he may
take such steps for this purpose as the law permits. The fact that the property to be
guarded is public property does not extend the protection given to a guard. Therefore, a
police constable on guard duty at a magazine or other public building is not entitled to
fire at a person merely because the latter does not answer his challenge.491. The
deceased, none of whom was in possession of any dangerous weapons, were
harvesting crop on a plot of land with peaceful intention under the protection of police.
The accused who claimed the crops did not approach the authorities for redress,
although they had time to do so, sent away the police constables by a ruse and then
attacked the deceased with guns and other dangerous weapons and shot them down
at close range. It was held by the Supreme Court that the acts of the deceased did not
amount to robbery and that the accused had no right of private defence of property.492.
The accused was in possession of the plots which were under litigation. Finding his
opponent, a blind man, getting the plots ploughed, the accused asked him to stop
ploughing. On this, 8–10 persons armed with spears and 'lathis' proceeded towards
him. The accused fired a shot from his gun causing death of his opponent, the blind
man. The Court observed that a blind villager could not be thought of going to take
possession of the plots without mobilising enough man power to deal with resistance
likely to be put up by his adversary. It was held that in the circumstances the right of
private defence of the person became available to the accused.493.
In the words of the Supreme Court, the High Court committed an error in relation to the
plea of self-defence raised on behalf of the accused to the effect that the incident took
place at an open space. There is no law that the right of self-defence cannot be
exercised in relation to an open space.494. Reasonable force may be used in defence of
property. It would not in general be reasonable to kill in defence of property alone.495.
[s 103.1] Trespasser.—
The right of private defence of property extending to causing of death is not available in
cases of trespass on open land.496.
[s 103.2] Causing death while on patrol duty.—
The accused constable killed his head constable. The accused was doing his patrolling
duty at the time on a bridge. He claimed to have fired at somebody whom he saw with
firearm near the value tower, which was neither used for human dwelling nor for
custody of property. He did not plead that he entertained apprehension of death or
grievous hurt. The Court said that the plea of private defence extending to the causing
of death was not tenable.497.
[s 103.3] CASES.—
The accused did not close his flour mill on the day of "Bharat Bandh", organized by
some political parties. The activists entered the mill and demanded closure. They were
armed with sharp-edged weapons. They threatened and assaulted the person who was
operating the mill. He fired at them resulting in death of two persons and also injuring
some innocent people. His property was set on fire. It was held that the acts of the
accused were within the reasonable limits of the right of private defence. His
conviction was set aside.498.

frontiers of private defence. Conviction was altered to one under section 304 Part I. Gokula v

wooden reaper on the head of the deceased causing death, the tree stood on the land of the
deceased and was in his actual physical possession, the right of private defence not available to
the accused. See also Govind Singh v State of Rajsthan, 1997 Cr LJ 1562 (Raj), no proof of
