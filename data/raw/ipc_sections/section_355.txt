Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave
provocation.
Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and
sudden provocation given by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which
may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.
Explanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an
offence under this section, if the provocation is sought or voluntarily provoked by the
offender as an excuse for the offence, or
if the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public
servant, in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or
if the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of
private defence.
Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a
question of fact.
COMMENT.—
This section provides punishment for assault or use of criminal force when there are no
aggravating circumstances.974. Section 352 constitutes a minor offence in relation to
section 354 IPC, 1860. The offence under section 354 IPC, 1860 includes the
ingredients of the former.975. See section 300, Exception 1, which is identical with the
explanation to this section.
[s 352.1] CASE.—
Where the accused persons formed an unlawful assembly with a common object, act
of unlawful assembly cannot be attributable with the subsequent change in the
common object of some of the other members of the assembly, it was held that
members who did not share common intention and stood outside were liable to be
convicted under section 352 read with149 and not under section 326 r/w. 149.976.
974. Nagar Prasad v State of UP, 1998 Cr LJ 1580 (All); R v Onabanjo, (2001) 2 Cr App R (S) 7 [CA
(Crim Div)], The accused appealed against a total sentence of 15 months' imprisonment, having
been convicted of common assault against his former girlfriend and of putting her in fear of
violence contrary to the Protection from Harassment Act, 1997 section 4 after she had ended
their relationship. The accused contended that the offences had been committed whilst he was
under the influence of alcohol and in response to his inability to cope with the breakdown of the
relationship.
It was held that repeated threats by the accused to kill justified the sentence imposed,
notwithstanding the presence of several mitigating factors including his attempts to seek help
for his alcohol addiction and depression. R v Tucknott, (2001) 1 Cr App R (S) 93 [CA (Crim Div)],
the accused was convicted for threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend and her new partner. The
threats were issued in prison to prison officers, stating intentions on release. The sentence was
imposed as it was deemed necessary in order to protect the public from a man who the court
held and shown himself to be capable of extreme violence against previous partners and who,
the medical experts and probation service agreed, was likely to re-offend.
It was held that given his early guilty plea and the fact that he could not realistically have carried
out the threats as he had been in prison at the time, the sentence was reduced to five years to
bring it in the sentencing in comparable cases.
