The Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904
(7 of 1904)
262.
 


Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The object of this measure is to preserve to India its ancient monuments in antiquities and to prevent the excavation by unauthorised persons of sites of historic interest and value.
2. In 1898 the question of antiquarian exploration and research attracted attention and the necessity of taking steps for the protection of monuments and relics of antiquity was impressed upon the Government of India. It was then apparent that legislation was required to enable the Government to discharge their responsibilities in the matter and a Bill was drafted on the lines of the existing Acts of Parliament modified so as to embody certain provisions which have found a place in recent legislation regarding the antiquities of Greece and Italy. This draft was circulated for the opinions of local Governments and their replies submitted showed that the proposals incorporated in it met with almost unanimous approval, the criticism received being directed, for the most part, against matters of detail. The draft has since been revised, the provisions of the Draft Bill prepared by the Government of Bengal have been embodied so far as they were found suitable and the present Bill is the result.
3. The first portion of the Bill deals with protection of "Ancient monuments" an expression which has been fined in clause 2 (now section 2). The measure will apply only to such of these as are from time to time expressly brought within its contents though being declared to be "protected monuments". A greater number of more famous buildings in India are already in possession or under the control of the Government; but there are others worthy of preservation which are in the hands of private owners. Some of these have already been insured or are fast falling into decay. The preservation of these is the chief object of the clause of the Bill now referred to and the provisions of the Bill are in general accordance with the policy enunciated in section 23 of the Religious Endowments Act, 1863 (
20 of 1863
), which recognises and saves the right of the Government "to prevent injury to and preserve buildings remarkable in their antiquity and for their-historical or architectural value or required for the convenience of the public".
The power to intervene is at present limited to cases to which section 3 of the Bengal Regulation 19 of 1810 or section 3 of the Madras Regulation VII of 1817 applies. In framing the present Bill the Government has aimed at having the necessity of goodwill and securing the co-operation of the owners concerned and it hopes that the action which it is proposed to take may tend rather to the encouragement than to the suppression of private effort. The Bill provides that the owner or the manager of the building which merits greater care than it has been receiving may be invited to enter into an agreement for its protection and that in the event of his refusing to come to terms the collector may proceed to acquire it compulsorily or take proper course to secure its application. It has been made clear that there is to be no resort to compulsory acquisition in the case the monument is used in connection with religious observances or in other case until the owner has had an opportunity of entering into an agreement of the kind indicated above; and it is expressly provided that the monument maintained by the Government under the proposed Act, shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with its character or with purpose of its foundation, and that, so far as is compatible with the object in view the public shall have access to it free of charge. By the 4th proviso of clause 11 (now section 10) it is laid down that in assessing the value of the monument for the purpose of compulsory acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (
1 of 1894
) its archaeological, artistic or historical merits shall not be taken into account. The object of the Government as purchaser being to preserve at the public expense and for the public benefit an ancient monument with all its associations, it is considered that the value of those associations should not be paid for.
[Note.-As the 4th proviso of clause 11 was the subject of unfavourable comment, it was omitted by the Select Committee.]
4. The second portion of the Bill deals with movable objects of historical or artistic interest and these may be divided into two classes: the first consists of ornaments, enamels, silver and copper vessels, Persian and Arabian Manuscripts, and curios general. These are for the most part portable and consequently difficult to trade; they are as a rule artistic; are of historic interest and it would be impracticable even were it desirable to prevent a dealer from selling and a traveller from buying them. The sculptural carvings, images, bas-reliefs, inscriptions and the like form a distinct class by themselves, in that their value depends upon their local connection. Such antiquities may as in the case of those of Swat, be found outside. India or in Native States and this the Legislature cannot reach directly; while as the regards the British territory and under the existing law, it is impossible to go beyond the provisions of the Indian Treasure Trove Act, 1878 (
6 of 1878
). (In these circumstances, it is proposed, by clause 18 of the Bill to take power to prevent the removal from British India of any antiquities which it may be deemed desirable to retain in the country, and at the same time to prevent importation. By thus putting a stop on draft in such articles it is believed that it will be possible to protect against spoilation a number of interesting places situated without and beyond British territory. Clause 19 aims at providing for antiquities such as sculptures and inscriptions which belong to another place and ought therefore to be kept in situ or deposited in local museums. The removal of these, it is proposed to enable the local Government to prohibit by notification and the clause also provides that, if the object is, movable, the owner may require the Government to purchase it outright and that, if it is immovable the Government shall compensate the owner for any loss caused to him by the prohibition. Clause 20 (now section 19) deals with the compulsory purchase of such antiquities if that is found to be necessary for their preservation and the owner is not willing on personal or religious grounds to part with them. In such cases it is proposed that the price to be paid should be assessed by the Collector, subject to a right of appeal to the local Government but it is for consideration whether the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 should be followed and reference to the Courts allowed.
5. The third portion of the Bill deals with excavations and gives power to make rules to prohibit or regulate such operations.
6. The general power to make rules is given by clause 22 (now section 23) and clause 23 (now section 24) is intended to protect acts done or in good faith intended to be done, under the law which it is now proposed to enact.
