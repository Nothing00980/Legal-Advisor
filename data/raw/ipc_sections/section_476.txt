Punishment for forgery.
Whoever commits forgery shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
The offence of forgery is defined in sections 463 and 464 of the Code. Under section
463 the making of a false document with any of the intents therein mentioned is
forgery, and section 464 sets forth when a person is said to make a 'false document'
within the meaning of the Code.
The definition of forgery in the Code is not as simple and clear as the definition of
forgery in common law. Forgery in common law is defined as the fraudulent making or
alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another man's right.
[s 465.1] Ingredients.—
The elements of forgery are—
1. The making of a false document or part of it.
2. Such making should be with the intent
(a) to cause damage or injury to (i) public, or (ii) any person; or
(b) to support any claim or title; or
(c) to cause any person to part with property; or
(d) to cause any person to enter into express or implied contract; or
(e) to commit fraud or that fraud may be committed.
1. 'Makes any false document'.— A school inspector prepared under his own signature
false pay bills containing false claims for salaries of teachers who had not worked
within his jurisdiction, some of whom being purely fictitious, and encashed them from
the treasury. He was held to be guilty of making a false document but not of forgery
because he had not made the signature or writing of another, nor had altered the pay
bills.18.
The antedating of a document is not forgery, unless it has or could have operated to the
prejudice of some one.19. Incorporation or inclusion of a false statement in a document
would not ipso facto make the document false. For a document to be false, it has to tell
a lie about itself.20.
[s 465.2] Publication of book.—
There was allegation that the accused person, in order to induce the public to purchase
the book, falsely represented that the book was by a certain person. There was no
allegation that the accused himself had written the book and represented it to be that
of some other person. The Court said such allegations, even if true, do not make out a
case of forgery. The offence of cheating could not also be said to have been made out
because it was a consequential offence.21.
Where the allegation was that the accused, who was working as a stenographer in the
High Court, had fabricated a forged bail order and the evidence showed that the bail
order in question was in fact written by the accused, the finding of the High Court that
the paper could not be said to be a document in the absence of signature of the
accused was held to be not tenable. The document could have been used for causing
wrongful loss or obtaining wrongful gain. Hence, the offence under sections 466 and
468 was made out.22.
2. 'To cause damage or injury to the public or to any person'.—The damage or injury
must be intended to be caused by the false document to the public or any individual.23.
Thus, a police-officer who alters his diary so as to show that he had not kept certain
persons under surveillance does not commit forgery, inasmuch as there is no risk of
loss or injury to any individual and the element of fraud as defined in section 25 is
absent.24. It is the intent to cause damage or injury which constitutes the gist of this
offence. It is immaterial whether damage, injury or fraud is actually caused or not.25.
Mere making of a false document would not constitute defrauding unless injury or
intent to cause injury to the person deceived was also proved.26.
To tamper with a proceeding in a Court of Justice in order to obtain from the Court a
decision or order, which it otherwise would not make, is as much a public mischief as
to attempt to secure the unauthorised release of a prisoner from jail or to obtain for an
unqualified person credentials entitling him to practise as a surgeon or to navigate a
ship.27.
3. 'Support any claim or title'.—Even if a man has a legal claim or title to property, he
will be guilty of forgery if he counterfeits documents in order to support it. See
illustrations (f), (g), (h) and (i). An actual intention to convert an illegal or doubtful claim
into an apparently legal one is dishonesty and will amount to forgery.28.
The term 'claim' is not limited in its application to a claim to property. It may be a claim
to anything, as for instance, a claim to a woman as the claimant's wife, a claim to the
custody of a child as being the claimant's child, or a claim to be admitted to attendance
at a law class in a college, or to be admitted to a university or other examination, or a
claim to the possession of immovable or any other kind of property.29.
4. 'To cause any person to part with property'.—It is not necessary that the property
with which it is intended that false document shall cause a person to part should be in
existence at the time when the false document was made. For example, if A gave an
order to B to buy the material for making and to make a silver tea service for him, and
C, before the tea service was made or the materials for making it had been bought
were to make a false letter purporting, but falsely, to be signed by A, authorizing B to
deliver to D the tea service when made, C would have committed forgery within the
meaning of section 463 by making that false document with intent to cause B to part
with property, namely, the tea service, when made.30. A written certificate has been
held to be 'property' within the meaning of this section.31.
5. 'Intent to commit fraud'.—The Supreme Court had held that the expression "defraud"
involves two elements, namely, deceit and injury to the person deceived. Injury is
something other than economic loss that is deprivation of property, whether movable
or immovable, or of money, and it will include any harm whatever caused to any person
in body, mind, reputation or such others. In short, it is a non-economic or non-pecuniary
loss. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver will almost always cause loss or detriment
to the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a benefit or advantage to the
deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived the second condition is
satisfied.32.
6. 'Fraudulently'.—This word is used in sections 471 and 464 together with the word
'dishonestly' and presumably in a sense not covered by the latter word. If, however, it be
held that 'fraudulently' implies deprivation, either actual or intended, then apparently
that word would perform no function which would not have been fully discharged by
the word 'dishonestly' and its use would be mere surplusage. So far as such a
consideration carries any weight, it obviously inclines in favour of the view that the
word 'fraudulently' should not be confined to transactions of which deprivation of
property forms a part.33.
7. 'Makes'.—"The 'making of a document, or part of a document, does not mean
'writing' or 'printing' it, but signing or otherwise executing it; as in legal phrase we speak
of 'making an indenture' or 'making a promissory note', by which is not meant the
writing out of the form of the instrument, but the sealing or signing it as a deed or note.
The fact that the word 'makes' is used in the section in conjunction with the words
'signs', 'seals' or 'executes', or 'makes any mark denoting the execution', etc., seems to
very clearly to denote that this is its true meaning. What constitutes a false document
or part of a document is not the writing of any number of words which in themselves
are innocent, but affixing the seal or signature of some person to the document, or part
of a document, knowing that the seal or signature is not his, and that he gave no
authority to affix it. In other words, the falsity consists in the document, or part of a
document, being signed or sealed with the name or seal of a person who did not in fact
sign or seal it".34.
[s 465.3] Fabricating letter or certificate.—
In a case, the allegation was that the accused made false document for getting sim
cards of mobile phones. Handwriting expert deposed that he was not in a position to
give any finding on basis of specimen signature of appellant. It was held that since
finding recorded by Special Judge was contrary to evidence given by handwriting
expert, conviction of appellant for offence punishable under section 465 read with
section 471 of IPC, 1860, could not be sustained.35. Where accused was alleged to
have obtained employment on strength of forged document, finding that accused had
not been proved to have forged the documents, it was held that offence under section
465 is not made out.36.
[s 465.4] Creation of a website by the company—
Where the appellant created a website with the name Devi Consultancy Services for the
development of the existing company named Devi Polymers Private Limited, in the
absence of any possibility to impute any intent to cause damage or injury or to enter
into any express or implied contract or any intent to commit fraud in the making of the
said website, no offence of forgery is made out, especially when he has not received a
single rupee or nor has he entered into any contract in his own name on the basis of
the above website.37.
[s 465.5] Acting for society after takeover.—
Where the entire management of a society was taken over by the petitioners and they
were looking after its affairs by writing letters, drawing cheques and operating bank
accounts by signing their names on behalf of the society and not on anybody else's
names or behalf, the offence of forgery/making false document was not made out.38.
[s 465.6] Alteration of document.—
The mere alteration of a document does not make it a forged document. The alteration
must be for some gain or for some objective. The Court said that presuming that figure
"1" was added to the date mentioned on the document, it could not be said that the
document became false. The accused had nothing to gain from it, nor it affected the
period of limitation.39.
[s 465.7] Clause second.—Alteration on or cancellation of document [Section
464].—
This clause requires dishonest or fraudulent cancellation or alteration of a document in
any material part without lawful authority after it has been made or executed by a
person who may be living or dead.
The conduct of an Advocate's clerk in forging the signature of another Advocate on a
surety bond and in altering certain endorsements for the purposes of identification and
attestation, was held by the Supreme Court as amounting to an offence under this
section and not under section 468.40.
[s 465.8] Sentence.—
Accused employed as a sanitation supervisor was found to have committed offence of
making fake trade licences and issuing them to various persons. Court below convicted
him for one year under section 471 read with section 465 IPC, 1860, and two years'
simple imprisonment (SI) under section 468, IPC imposed upon him. Considering the
fact that he was a first offender and an orphan and sole bread earner of his family
which consisted of a minor child and an unemployed wife, the sentence under section
471 read with section 465 IPC, 1860 was reduced to one month and the sentence
under section 468 IPC, 1860 was reduced to two months.41.
