State Amendment
Andhra Pradesh.— In Andhra Pradesh the offence is cognizable vide A.P. G.O. Ms. No.
732, dated 5-12-1991.
COMMENT.—
The authors of the Code observe: "In framing this clause we had two objects in view:
we wish to allow all fair latitude to religious discussion, and at the same time to prevent
the professors of any religion from offering, under the pretext of such discussion,
intentional insults to what is held sacred by others. We do not conceive that any person
can be justified in wounding with deliberate intention the religious feelings of his
neighbours by words, gestures or exhibitions. A warm expression dropped in the heat
of controversy, or an argument urged by a person, not for the purpose of insulting and
annoying the professors of a different creed, but in good faith for the purpose of
vindicating his own will not fall under the definition contained in this clause."46. This
section does not apply to a written article.47.
This section can be made cognizable by the State Government by a notification in the
official Gazette under section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932.
The malicious intention should either be shown to exist or should be apparent from the
nature of the act alleged to constitute an offense.48.
[s 298.1] CASES.—
Interpolation of forbidden chant.— Interpolation of a forbidden chant in an authorised
ritual is an offence under this section.49.
[s 298.2] Exhibiting cow's flesh.—
Exhibiting cow's flesh by carrying it in an uncovered state round a village with the
deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of Hindus was held to be an
offence under this section.50.
[s 298.3] Killing of cow.—
Where on the occasion of Bakr-i-Id, the accused killed a cow at dawn in a semi-private
place and the killing was seen by some Hindus walking along the village pathway 50
feet away, it was held that no offence under this section was committed.51. The
sacrifice of a cow on the Bakr-i-Id day is not an obligatory religious act for a Muslim
and the protection of Article 25 of the Constitution cannot be claimed for such an
act.52.
