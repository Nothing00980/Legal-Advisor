COMMENT.—
The preceding section punishes the receiver of a gift in consideration of compromising
an offence, whereas this section punishes the offerer of the gift.
[s 214.1] Ingredients.—
This section has two essentials—
1. Offering any gratification or restoration of property to some person.
2. Such offer must have been in consideration of the person's (a) concealing an
offence, or (b) of his screening any person from legal punishment for an offence, or (c)
of his not proceeding against a person, for the purpose of bringing him to legal
punishment. The section presupposes the actual commission of an offence or the guilt
of the person screened from punishment. Where the accused, an overseer who was
charged with preparing false muster rolls and misappropriating Government money
allegedly tried to bribe someone with a view to prevent action being taken against him
and was thus prosecuted under sections 165A and 214, IPC, 1860, but was acquitted of
the offence under section 165A, IPC, 1860, for want of evidence, he could not also be
convicted in view of infirmities of the case of an offence under section 214, IPC,
1860.295.
Section 320(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code enumerates the offences that can be
lawfully compounded.
