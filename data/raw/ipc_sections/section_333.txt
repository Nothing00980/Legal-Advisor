COMMENT.—
This section is similar to section 327 which deals with causing of hurt for the purpose
of extorting property or valuable security. It punishes the inducing of a person by
causing hurt to make a statement, or a confession, having reference to an offence or
misconduct; and whether that offence or misconduct has been committed is wholly
immaterial.859. An offence under this section is made out if it is proved that the
accused caused hurt to extort confession or any information. If the victim dies later it
is not necessary to prove that death was a result of the hurt caused.860. The offence is
complete as soon as the hurt is caused to extort confession or any information.
[s 330.1] Custodial Torture.—
Though sections 330 and 331 of the IPC, 1860 make punishable those persons who
cause hurt for the purpose of extorting the confession by making the offence
punishable with sentence up to 10 years of imprisonment, but the convictions, as
experience shows from track record have been very few compared to the considerable
increase of such onslaught because the atrocities within the precincts of the police
station are often left without much traces or any ocular or other direct evidence to
prove as to who the offenders are. Disturbed by this situation the Law Commission in
its 113th Report recommended amendments to the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 so as to
provide that in the prosecution of a police officer for an alleged offence of having
caused bodily injuries to a person while in police custody, if there is evidence that the
injury was caused during the period when the person was in the police custody, the
Court may presume that the injury was caused by the police officer having the custody
of that person during that period unless the police officer proves to the contrary. The
onus to prove the contrary must be discharged by the police official concerned.
Keeping in view the dehumanising aspect of the crime, the flagrant violation of the
fundamental rights of the victim of the crime and the growing rise in the crimes of this
type, where only a few come to light and others don't, the Government and the
legislature must give serious thought to the recommendation of the Law Commission
and bring about the appropriate changes in the law not only to curb the custodial crime
but also to see that the custodial crime does not go unpunished. The Courts are also
required to have a change in their outlook approach, appreciation and attitude,
particularly in cases involving custodial crimes and they should exhibit more sensitivity
and adopt a realistic rather than a narrow technical approach, while dealing with the
cases of custodial crime so that as far as possible within their powers, the truth is
found and guilty should not escape so that the victim of the crime has the satisfaction
that ultimately the majesty of law has prevailed.861.
Where daughter of accused and son of complainant married each other. Complainant
and his family members were brutally tortured by police officials it was held that order
framing charge against petitioner was proper.862.
Where the accused, the investigating officer and his assistant, entertained suspicion
about two persons in a case of theft and subjected the suspects to ill-treatment to
extort confession or information leading to detection of stolen properties, the accused
were held guilty of offence under section 330.863.
[s 330.2] Conviction under sections 302, 330 and 34 based on an unsigned
dying declaration.—Death caused by police officers to extract confession based on
dying declaration. Guidelines issued by the Delhi High Court that the declaration should
carry the signature of the declarant not observed. Held that the issuance of the
guidelines is for ensuring and for testing the genuineness of the dying declaration of
person, who is in the last moment of his life. Merely because there was a defect in
following the said guideline, which, as is now pointed out, is of a trivial nature and if the
dying declaration recorded is otherwise proved by ample evidence, both oral as well as
documentary, on the ground of such trivial defects, the whole of the dying declaration
cannot be thrown out by the reason of such trivial defects.864.
[s 330.3] As to the mind of the declarant.—
It is true that when a person is on his or her deathbed, there is no reason to state a
falsehood but it is equally true that it is not possible to delve into the mind of a person
who is facing death.865.
[s 330.4] Abetment.—
Where the accused stood by and acquiesced in an assault on a prisoner committed by
another policeman for the purpose of extorting a confession, it was held that he
abetted the offence under this section.866.
