Causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of
others.
Whoever causes grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently
as to endanger human life, or the personal safety of others, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with
fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.
COMMENT.—
The last section provided for 'hurt', this section provides for 'grievous hurt' caused
under similar circumstances. Section 338, IPC, 1860 is applicable when the other
ingredients of section 337, IPC, 1860 are complied with and in addition to that, if a
grievous hurt is caused to someone.899.
[s 338.1] CASES.—Sexual intercourse causing injury.—
A husband has not the absolute right to enjoy the person of his wife without regard to
the question of safety to her. Hence, where a husband had sexual intercourse with his
wife, aged 11 years, and she died from the injuries thereof, it was held that he was
guilty of causing grievous hurt by doing a rash act under this section.900. Clause (6) of
section 375 will now make the husband guilty of rape also. Where a driver of a motor
bus, by reason of his inattention and failure to apply brakes, pressed a person against a
wall, he was held to have committed an offence under this section as well as under
section 279.901.
[s 338.2] Running over by cart.—
Where a person, by allowing his cart to proceed unattended along a road, ran over a boy
who was sleeping on the road, it was held that he had committed an offence under
section 337 or section 338.902.
[s 338.3] Section 304 Part II and section 338.—
The scheme of sections 279, 304A, 336, 337 and 338 leaves no manner of doubt that
these offences are punished because of the inherent danger of the acts specified
therein irrespective of knowledge or intention to produce the result and irrespective of
the result. These sections make punishable the acts themselves which are likely to
cause death or injury to human life. The question is whether indictment of an accused
under section 304 Part II and section 338 IPC, 1860 can co-exist in a case of single
rash or negligent act. It can, two charges are not mutually destructive. If the act is done
with the knowledge of the dangerous consequences which are likely to follow and if
death is caused then not only that the punishment is for the act but also for the
resulting homicide and a case may fall within section 299 or section 300 depending
upon the mental state of the accused viz., as to whether the act was done with one
kind of knowledge or the other or the intention. Knowledge is awareness on the part of
the person concerned of the consequences of his act of omission or commission
indicating his state of mind. There may be knowledge of likely consequences without
any intention. Criminal culpability is determined by referring to what a person with
reasonable prudence would have known.903.
[s 338.4] Medical negligence, criminal liability.—
The only state of mind which is deserving of punishment is that, which demonstrates
an intention to cause harm to others, or where there is a deliberate willingness to
subject others to the risk of harm. Negligent conduct does not entail an intention to
cause harm, but only involves a deliberate act subjecting another to the risk of harm,
where the actor is aware of the existence of the risk and, nonetheless, proceeds in the
face of the risk.904.
[s 338.5] Offences under Factories Act, 1948.—
The ingredients of section 337 and section 338, IPC, 1860 and the provisions of the
Andhra Pradesh Fire Services Act, 1999 and the Factories Act, 1948 cannot be said to
be one and the same. They apply to different situations for different purposes and for
different measures to be taken by the owner or occupier of the factories. Even the
steps to be taken under both the enactments are different as discussed above, and
even if no fire accident had taken place, the provisions of Factories Act, 1948 and the
Fire Services Act will apply. But when there is no accident, section 337 and section 338,
IPC, 1860 do not apply. Sections 337 and 338, IPC, 1860 are applicable where the
owner or occupier, knowing very well that no preventive steps were taken and it will be
dangerous for the workers to work in such a situation and without any due regard to the
consequences which a man would think and for the safety of the workers, extract work
from them and wherein from the circumstances it appears that such an act of
extracting work from workers amount to acting in rash and negligent manner.
Therefore, to attract section 337 and section 338, IPC, 1860 something more, i.e.,
careless and negligent act is required to be proved, even after proving of violation of
provisions of Fire Services Act and the Factories Act, 1948. Thus, it is clear that section
337 and section 338, IPC, 1860 are applicable only in aggravated situations besides
violation of the provisions of the Fire Services Act and the Factories Act, 1948.905. The
expression act includes omission.906.
