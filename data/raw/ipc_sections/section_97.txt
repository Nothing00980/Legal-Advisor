Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by
consent of guardian.
Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of
age, or of unsound mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian
or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any
harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or be known by the doer
to be likely to cause to that person:
Provided—
Provisos.
First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or
to the attempting to cause death;
Secondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the
person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the
preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or
infirmity; Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of
grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the
purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous
disease or infirmity;
Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to
the committing of which offence it would not extend.
ILLUSTRATION
A, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut
for the stone by a surgeon. Knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the
child's death, but not intending to cause the child's death. A is within the exception,
inasmuch as his object was the cure of the child.
COMMENT.—
This section empowers the guardian of an infant under 12 years or an insane person to
consent to the infliction of harm to the infant or the insane person, provided it is done
in good faith and is done for his benefit. Persons above 12 years are considered to be
capable of giving consent under section 88. The consent of the guardian of a sufferer,
who is an infant or who is of unsound mind, shall have the same effect which the
consent of the sufferer himself would have, if the sufferer were of ripe age and sound
mind.
[s 89.1] Corporal punishment to children.—
Corporal punishment to child, in present days, is not recognized by law. It is an archaic
notion that to maintain discipline, child can be punished physically by the teaching staff
because of implied consent by the parents or guardian. Now it is recognized social
principle that even parents of the child are made to understand the basic human rights
of the child and instead of corporal punishment, correctional methods are recognized
in law.218. But the applicability of sections 88 and 89, IPC, 1860 and administering of
corporal punishments on students by the teachers for their benefit, came up for
consideration in M Natesan v State of Madras.219. It was a case where a boy of 15 years
was sent with the progress report to get the signature of his parents in it. But he
returned it with a thumb impression of another person, stating that the said thumb
impression was that of his mother, which was proved to be wrong. The teacher got
agitated and he beat the boy on his right palm with a stick. He did not cry. He, therefore,
beat him again, asking him why he did not cry. This resulted in causing three injuries,
two superficial and one contusion. The Madras High Court held that:
It cannot be denied that having regard to the peculiar position of a school teacher he must
in the nature of things have authority to enforce discipline and correct a pupil put in his
charge. To deny that authority would amount to a denial of all that is desirable and
necessary for the welfare, discipline and education of the pupil concerned. It can therefore
be assumed that when a parent entrusted a child to a teacher, he on his behalf impliedly
consents for the teacher to exercise over the pupil such authority. Of course, the person of
the pupil is certainly protected by the penal provisions of the Indian Penal Code. But the
same code has recognised exceptions in the form of ss. 88 and 89. Where a teacher
exceeds the authority and inflicts such harm to the pupil as may be considered to be
unreasonable and immoderate, he would naturally lose the benefit of the exceptions.
Whether he is entitled to the benefit of the exceptions or not in a given case will depend
upon the particular nature, extent and severity of the punishment inflicted.
220.In K A Abdul Vahid v State of Kerala,221. the Kerala High Court considered the
question when a school teacher, beats a student with a cane, who created commotion
in the school or showed disobedience to the Rules, whether he could be proceeded
against under the provisions of the IPC, 1860 and found that the teacher has acted
within the exception conferred on him, under section 88 of IPC, 1860.
