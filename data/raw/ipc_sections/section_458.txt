description for a term which may extend to three months, with fine or which may
extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.
COMMENT—
A party claimed title by adverse possession. The other filed a complaint for criminal
trespass. The complaint was dismissed for the fact that the dispute was of civil nature.
It was held that such acquittal did not have the effect of proving the existence of title
by adverse possession.686. Where the land in question was not shown to be in the
exclusive possession of the complainant, and the accused having his right of entry, his
entry into the land did not constitute a criminal trespass.687. Where certain land was
allotted to the complainant but the same was already in the possession of the accused,
the offence of criminal trespass was not made out because mere occupation even if
illegal cannot amount to criminal trespass.688.
[s 447.1] Continuing offence.—
Trespass is a continuing offence. Allegation is that petitioners had constructed a wall
on the retaining wall of the complainant. The petitioners in the petition have not
projected the case that they had removed alleged wall. Thus, it is a continuing offence
under section 472 Cr PC, 1973. The bar of limitation is not applicable.689.
