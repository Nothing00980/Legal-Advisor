COMMENTâ€”
This section punishes simple cases of cheating. Where there is delivery of any property
or destruction of any valuable security, section 420 is the proper section to apply.536.
The accused made false representation to the complainant by way of promise to marry
her and believing such promise she complied with his request by sharing the bed
together. Consequently she became pregnant but he refused to marry her. The accused
challenged the proceedings initiated against him under section 417. It was held that
prima facie case was made out under the section.537.
Certain letters were prepared on the letterhead of a Minister by the accused by which
actors were invited to a cultural show. Letters did not carry the signature of the
Minister. The Court said that the act of the accused did not cause nor was likely to
cause any harm to any person in mind or body. His conviction under section 417 was
held to be not proper.538. Only because accused issued cheques which were
dishonoured, the same by itself would not mean that he had cheated the complainant.
Assuming that such a statement had been made, the same, does not exhibit that there
had been any intention on the part of the appellant herein to commit an offence under
section 417 of the Penal Code.539. Where accused giving assurance of marriage to
victim girl had undergone intercourse with victim and she would not have undergone
intercourse had there been no such assurance of marriage by accused. Accused
subsequently having disowned assurance given by him. It was held that ingredients of
cheating under section 415 can be said to have been established. Accused held guilty
of committing offence punishable under section 417 of Code.540. Where accused is
liable to be convicted under section 376 on allegation sexual intercourse by false
promise of marriage there cannot be any separate conviction under section 417.541.
Though once the accused-appellant alleged failed to keep his promise she allowed him
to commit sexual intercourse for the second time and invited her pregnancy. Not only
that, even after termination of pregnancy for the second time she again allowed the
accused-appellant to have sexual intercourse with her and make her pregnant for the
third time. Offence under section 417 not made out.542. Accused allegedly committed
sexual intercourse on prosecutrix on pretext that he would provide temporary job of
peon to her in bank which would be regularized after completion of one year. Though
the offence under section 376 is not made out, offence under section 417 is made
out.543. Where accused wanted to marry prosecutrix and on her refusal committed
forcible sexual intercourse with her. But, if the promise of marriage was given and the
girl had succumbed on that account, by itself, may not amount to cheating. Besides
this, the girl has very specifically stated that even subsequently, she was ravished
against her wishes. Therefore, the theory of promise of marriage and the consent for
sexual intercourse will wither away, acquit the accused of the offence under section
417 of IPC, 1860 though he was convicted under section 376 IPC, 1860.544.
536. No process was issued where the allegations were that the girl was represented to be as
hale and hearty and it was found after the marriage that she was weak of sight and had urinary
infection. The complaint dismissed. Anilchandra Pitambardas v Rajesh, 1991 Cr LJ 487 (Bom).
