Public servant unlawfully buying or bidding for property.
Whoever, being a public servant, and being legally bound as such public servant, not
to purchase or bid for certain property, purchases or bids for that property, either in
his own name or in the name of another, or jointly, or in shares with others, shall be
punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with
fine, or with both; and the property, if purchased, shall be confiscated.
COMMENT—
Buying or holding property.—This section is merely an extension of the principle
enunciated in the last section. It prohibits a public servant from purchasing or bidding
for property which he is legally bound not to purchase.
It is necessary that there should be some statutory law or rules or regulations framed
under the law and not merely some administrative instructions or guidelines prohibiting
public servants from purchasing certain property. In this case, a Code of Conduct was
issued by the State Government in the exercise of its executive power under Article 162
of the Constitution under which Ministers were prohibited from buying Government
properties. There were no mandatory terms providing for any action in case of non-
compliance. It was held that the Code of Conduct did not have the effect of law. Its
violation could not generate legal proceedings there being nothing unlawful illegal
within the meaning of section 43. The purchase of property of a Government company
by a firm in which the then Chief Minister was a partner did not constitute an offence
under section 169 in the absence of any law debarring the Chief Minister from making
such a purchase.14.
[s 169.1] TANSI land deal case.—
The allegation was that the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Ms. Jayalalithaa, while holding
the chief minister's post, had violated the code of conduct and purchased 3.0786 acres
of land and buildings to the state-owned Tamil Nadu State Industries Corporation for
Jaya Publications. While reversing the conviction passed by the High Court, the
Supreme Court held that the offence under section 169 IPC, 1860 is incomplete without
the assistance of some other enactment which imposes the legal prohibition required.
Therefore, in order to come within the clutches of section 169 IPC, 1860, there should
be a law which prohibits a public servant from purchasing certain property and if he
does it, it becomes an offence under section 169 IPC, 1860. Section 481 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, section 189 of the Railways Act, 1989 and section 19 of the Cattle
Trespass Act, 1871 and instances of that nature in several enactments are available in
which persons mentioned therein shall not directly or indirectly purchase any property
at a sale under those Acts. Similarly section 136 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882
provides that no Judge, legal practitioner, or officer connected with any Court of Justice
shall buy or traffic in, or stipulate for, or agree to receive any share of, or interest in, any
actionable claim and no Court of Justice shall enforce, at his instance, or at the
instance of any person claiming by or through him, any actionable claims so dealt with
by him as stated above. Thus, in these circumstances where a law has prohibited
purchase of property or to bid at an auction, the prohibition contained therein will be
attracted and will become an offence under section 169 IPC, 1860. The Code of
Conduct not having a statutory force and not enforceable in a Court of law, nor having
any sanction or procedure for dealing with a contravention thereof by the Chief
Minister, cannot be construed to impose a legal prohibition against the purchase of
property of the Government so as to give rise to a criminal offence under section 169
IPC, 1860.15.
