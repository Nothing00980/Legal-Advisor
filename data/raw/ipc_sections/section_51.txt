"Injury.".
The word "injury" denotes any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in body,
mind, reputation or property.
COMMENTâ€”
'Injury' is an act contrary to law.314. It will include any tortious act.
A Magistrate imposed a fine in addition to a sentence of imprisonment on a conviction
for the offence of causing death by a rash and negligent act and gave compensation to
the widow of the deceased out of the fine imposed. It was held that compensation
could not be given to her for she did not suffer any injury as here defined.315. It may,
however, be argued that nothing could be more harmful to the mind of a woman than
the death of her husband, and the section speaks of harm to the mind as 'injury'. The
former Chief Court of the Punjab held that loss of her husband's support affected a
widow prejudicially in a legal right, and was therefore, an injury as defined in the Penal
Code.316. The context of section 125(1)(c) does not require reference to the definition
of 'injury' rendered in section 44 IPC, 1860. The words "physical or mental abnormality"
will prima facie take in congenital defects while 'injury' leading to inability to maintain
itself can have reference, be at any point of time even after the attaining of majority. It
may even be possible to take in all cases of physical or mental abnormality which need
not necessarily be congenital.317. As defined in section 44 IPC, 1860, "injury" denotes
any harm whatever illegally caused to any person in body, mind, reputation or property.
Now, if a person wants to save himself from injury, such as conviction in a criminal
case, it does not mean that he caused injury to another.318. Harm caused to a
reputation has been held to constitute an injury, within the purview of section 44.319.
