The Foreign Recruiting Act, 1874
(4 OF 1874)

/588
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-In the present state of the law, as appears from a legal opinion lately submitted to the Government of India, there is nothing to prevent our Indian territories being made a recruiting ground for Foreign States on the Continent of India or elsewhere. It seems that the agents of such State may beat up for recruits in a way to expose the Government to serious embarrassment, with foreign nations if they do not interfere, and with their own subjects if they do.
It is only when the recruiting is for the "service of any Foreign State at war with any Foreign State at peace with Her Majesty" that the provisions of the English Foreign Enlistment Act (33 and 34 Vic., cap. 90) apply, and the Indian Emigration Act, to which a reference is naturally made in connection with a matter of this kind, is confined in its operation to emigrant labourers, that is to say, taking the word in its ordinary acceptation, to persons emigrating with a view to obtaining employment in husbandry or manufactures.
The object of the present Bill is to confer on the Governor General in Council the power of control which thus appears to be wanting, and which at the same time it is manifestly desirable he should possess.
