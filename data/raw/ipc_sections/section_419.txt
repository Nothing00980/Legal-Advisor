COMMENT—
Section 381 punishes theft by a clerk or a servant. This section inflicts enhanced
punishment on such a person for criminal breach of trust. The property must have been
entrusted to the accused in his capacity as a clerk or a servant. A clerk or a servant
who takes his master's property is punishable for theft.
1. 'Clerk'.—A clerk in modern usage means a writer in an office, public or private, either
for keeping accounts or entering minutes.
2. 'Servant'.—Master and servant—a relation whereby a person calls in the assistance
of others, where his own skill and labour are not sufficient to carry out his own
business or purpose.358. A servant acts under the direct control and supervision of the
master and is bound to conform to all reasonable orders given in the course of his
work.359.
3. 'Employed as a clerk or servant'.—Where the accused employee dishonestly
misappropriated money entrusted with him and left the service and there is no
documentary evidence except extra-judicial confession of accused Court held that
accused is entitled to acquittal.360. Where a person sent his salesman with a letter to
fetch Rs. 10,000 from his residence and he, instead of returning, slipped away with the
money, it was held that the fact that he absconded for a number of days clearly
established his intention of causing wrongful gain for himself.361.
In the prosecution of an employee under this section, the original account books were
destroyed after the matter was decided by the sessions' judge, so that it was
impossible for the appellate Court to verify the correctness of the questionable entries
and the other evidence was of suspicious nature, the Court had no choice but to acquit
the accused.362. The Court relied upon its own earlier decision363. where it was
observed: "The appellate court and the revisional court are entitled, while scrutinising
the case against the accused, to have complete material before it on which the
prosecution relies for proving the case against the accused persons. In the present
case, to deprive this court of the benefit of looking at the entries, in a serious infirmity
which must be held fatal to the prosecution case."364.

facie dishonest and he was properly convicted under section 408.365.
