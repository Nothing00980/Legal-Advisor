Live-Stock Importation Act, 1898
(Act 
No. 9 of 1898
)
Object and Reasons The importation into one of the sea ports of British India of a cargo of horses from Australia, which proved to be infected with the tick disease - a disease very fatal to cattle and capable of being conveyed by other animals, such as horses, themselves immune from it - led to an examination of the existing legal powers of the Government to prevent the importation of live-stock liable to be affected by infectious or contagious disorders. As these powers were found to be defective it has been decided, in consultation with the Governments of Madras, Bombay and Bengal, to take the necessary powers. Instead of amending the Indian Ports Act (10 of 1889), it is thought preferable to proceed by way of self-contained Act.
The provisions of the Bill are general in character, and empower the Governor-General in Council to regulate, restrict or prohibit the importation into British India by land or sea of any live-stock which may be liable to be affected by infectious or contagious disorders. The Bill confers necessary powers on officers of Customs at every port, and enables Local Governments to make rules for detention, inspection, disinfection or destruction of such stock, and for the guidance of officers appointed under the rules.
It is not intended to interfere with the inland trade, except so far as to prevent the removal of live-stock, the importation of which has been prohibited, from one part of British India to another." - Gazette of India, 1898, Part V, page 282.
