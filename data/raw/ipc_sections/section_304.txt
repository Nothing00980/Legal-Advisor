Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose
death was intended.
If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death,
commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he
neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide
committed by the offender is of the description of which it would have been if he had
caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely
to cause.
COMMENT.—
Doctrine of transferred malice.—Section 301 of IPC, 1860 specifies that if a person by
doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits
culpable homicide by causing death of any person whose death he neither intends, nor
knows himself to be likely to cause, culpable homicide committed by the offender is of
the description of which it would have been, if he had caused the death of the person,
whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely to cause.183. Blow aimed at the
intended victim, if alights on another, offence is the same as it would have been if the
blow had struck the intended victim.184. This section lays down that culpable homicide
may be committed by causing the death of a person whom the offender neither
intended, nor knew himself to be likely, to kill. This section embodies what the English
authors describe as the doctrine of transfer of malice or the transmigration of motive.
Under this section, if A intends to kill B but kills C whose death he neither intends nor
knows himself to be likely to cause, the intention to kill C is, by law attributed to
him.185.
If the killing takes place in the course of doing an act which a person intends or knows
to be likely to cause death, it ought to be treated as if the real intention of the killer had
been actually carried out.
Where a mistake is made in respect of the person, as where the offender shoots at A
supposing that he is shooting at B, it is clear that the difference of person can make
none in the offence or its consequences; the crime consists in the wilful doing of a
prohibited act; the act of shooting at A was wilful, although the offender mistook him
for another.
Where the accused was deliberately trying to shoot at a fleeing man who had criticised
his father in a School Committee Meeting but unfortunately his own maternal uncle
came in between him and the intended victim and thus got killed, it was held that the
act of the accused was nothing but murder under section 302 read with section 301,
IPC, 1860.186. In an altercation between parties, the accused persons fired
indiscriminately upon the fleeing party, one shot hit a person and second caused the
death of the complainant's 10-year-old son. The episode took place in a commercial
locality. The death was held to be intentional murder punishable under sections
300/301.187. The accused reached his intended victim's house. The latter hid himself
somewhere else. The accused chased him there and standing before that house fired
into it. The housewife became prey and fell dead. It was held that under the doctrine of
transfer of malice, the accused must be convicted under sections 302 and 307 and
sentenced to life imprisonment.188. Where the accused intended to kill a particular
person by his lorry but another person chanced to come before the lorry and happened
to be killed, an offence under this section was committed and the accused was
convicted under section 302.189.
Similarly, there will be no difference where the injury intended for one falls on another
by accident. If A makes a thrust at B, meaning to kill, and C throwing himself between,
receives the thrust and dies, A will answer for it as if his mortal purpose had taken
place on B.
The same principle is applicable where, through accident or the mistake of a party not
privy to the criminal design, the mischief falls either on a person not intended, or on the
party intended but in a different manner from that intended.190. Accused had entered
the house of witness to kill him but due to non-availability of electricity and under the
wrong impression he killed the deceased. Death of deceased can be said to be
accidental due to mistaken identity rather than any intentional act of accused. Order of
conviction of accused under section 302, IPC, 1860 is modified to one under section
304, Part II, IPC, 1860.191.
In a scuffle between accused persons and the complainant's party, one member on the
accused's side fired a shot at a particular member on the complainant's side but the
shot actually hit another person who died. The Court held that the doctrine of
transferred malice was attracted. The act of the accused would be covered by section
304 and he was liable to be convicted under Part II of that section, though the
deceased was neither aimed at nor intended to be harmed by the accused.192.
It is not a disputed fact as to whose fire shot resulted in the death of the deceased. The
only question which is to be examined here is whether the offence committed by the
respondent is culpable homicide amounting to murder, punishable under section 302 or
culpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable under section 304, Part I. Here,
the intention on the part of the respondent-accused in causing bodily injury as is likely
to cause death is also not a disputed fact. The only thing which is to be tested is
whether the bodily injury is covered under either of the clauses of section 300 of IPC,
1860 (transfer of malice doctrine applied).193.
[s 301.1] Transfer of malice.—
The accused intended to cause death of his victim. But the stab aimed at him fell on
the chest of the deceased resulting in his death. It was held that as per the doctrine of
transfer of malice, it must be presumed that the accused intended to cause death of
the deceased alone. His act attracted the offence under section 301 read with section
302.194.
[s 301.2] CASES.—
Four persons were shooting at R in furtherance of their common intention to kill M, in
the bona fide belief that R was M. R died as a result of the gunshot wounds. It was held
by the Supreme Court that the accuseds were guilty under section 302 read with
section 34 and that section 301 had no application.195.
