Exposure and abandonment of child under 12 years of age, by parent or
person having care of it.
Whoever being the father or mother of a child under the age of twelve years, or having
the care of such child, shall expose or leave such child in any place with the intention
of wholly abandoning such child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.
Explanation.—This section is not intended to prevent the trial of the offender for
murder or culpable homicide, as the case may be, if the child dies in consequence of
the exposure.
COMMENT.—
This section is intended to prevent the abandonment or desertion by a parent of his or
her children of tender years, in such a manner that the children, not being able to take
care of themselves, may run the risk of dying or being injured. It does not apply when
children are left under the care of others.710. It applies where a child is exposed and no
death supervenes; if, however, death follows, the conviction must be under section
304.711. The offence is complete notwithstanding that no actual danger or risk of
danger arises to the child's life.
