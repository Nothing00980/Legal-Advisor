description for a term which may extend to seven years, or, if the offence be not
committed, with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend

ILLUSTRATION
A, knowing that dacoity is about to be committed at B, falsely informs the Magistrate
that a dacoity is about to be committed at C, a place in an opposite direction, and
thereby misleads the Magistrate with intent to facilitate the commission of the offence.
The dacoity is committed at B in pursuance of the design. A is punishable under this
section.
COMMENT—
Concealing design to commit offence.—Sections 118, 119 and 120 all contemplate the
concealment of a design by persons other than the accused to commit the offence
charged. These sections apply to the concealment of all offences except those which
are merely punishable with fine. Under section 107 concealment of a design to commit
an offence constitutes an abetment. There must be an obligation on the person
concealing the offence to disclose.124. The Cr PC, 1973 creates such obligation in
respect of several offences of a serious nature (sections 39 and 40 Cr PC, 1973). The
concealment to be criminal must be intentional or at least with knowledge that it will
facilitate the commission of an offence.
