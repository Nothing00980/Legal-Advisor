COMMENT—
Aiding mutiny, seduction from duty.—The first part of this section relates to the offence
of abetting mutiny. The offence contemplated is an abetment which is not followed by
actual mutiny, or which, supposing actual mutiny follows, is not the cause of that
mutiny.
The offence of 'mutiny' consists in extreme insubordination, as if a soldier resists by
force, or if a number of soldiers rise against or oppose their military superiors, such
acts proceeding from alleged or pretended grievances of a military nature. Acts of a
riotous nature directed against the government or civil authorities rather than against
military superiors seem also to constitute mutiny.17.
