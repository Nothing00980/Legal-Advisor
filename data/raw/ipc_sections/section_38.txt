"Act" "Omission";.
The word "act" denotes as well a series of acts as a single act: the word "omission"
denotes as well a series of omissions as a single omission.
COMMENTâ€”
An omission is sometimes called a negative act, but this seems dangerous practice, for
it too easily permits an omission to be substituted for an act without requiring the
special requirement for omission liability such as legal duty and the physical capacity
to perform the act. Criminal liability for an omission is also well accepted where the
actor has a legal duty and the capacity to act. It is said that this rather fundamental
exception to the act requirement is permitted because an actor's failure to perform a
legal duty of which he is capable, satisfies the purposes of the act requirement or at
least satisfies them as well as an act does. Specifically these two special requirements
for omission liability help to exclude from liability cases of fantasizing and irresolute
intentions, important purposes of the act requirement.168. The effect of section 32 and
this section taken together is that the term 'act' comprises one or more acts or one or
more illegal omissions. The word 'act' does not mean only any particular, specific,
instantaneous act of a person, but denotes, as well, a series of acts.169.
