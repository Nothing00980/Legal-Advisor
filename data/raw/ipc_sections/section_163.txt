Liability of person for whose benefit riot is committed.
Whenever a riot is committed for the benefit or on behalf of any person who is the
owner or occupier of any land, respecting which such riot takes place or who claims
any interest in such land, or in the subject of any dispute which gave rise to the riot, or
who has accepted or derived any benefit therefrom, such person shall be punishable
with fine, if he or his agent or manager, having reason to believe that such riot was
likely to be committed or that the unlawful assembly by which such riot was
committed was likely to be held, shall not respectively use all lawful means in his or
their power to prevent such assembly or riot from taking place, and for suppressing
and dispersing the same.
COMMENT—
Liability of beneficiary of riot.—Under the preceding section the owner of land is
punishable for the taking place of an unlawful assembly or riot on his land. This section
requires that the unlawful assembly or riot should take place in the interest of the
owner or any person claiming interest in the land. The section, therefore, imposes
unlimited fine. The preceding section refers to an unlawful assembly, as well as a riot;
this section refers to riot only.
The principle on which this and the following sections proceed is to subject to fine all
persons in whose interest a riot is committed and the agents of such persons, unless it
can be shown that they did what they lawfully could to prevent the offence.
