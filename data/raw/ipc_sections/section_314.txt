Punishment.
Whoever is a thug shall be punished with 689.[imprisonment for life], and shall also be
liable to fine.
COMMENT.â€”
Gangs of persons habitually associated for the purpose of inveigling and murdering
travellers or others in order to take their property, etc., are called thugs. Thugs are
robbers and dacoits, but all robbers and dacoits are not thugs. Thugs committed
robbery or dacoity or kidnapping are always accompanied with murder. Killing of the
victim was the essential thing (still in MP & UP ravines).
689. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, section 117 and Sch, for "transportation for life" (w.e.f. 1-1-1956).
