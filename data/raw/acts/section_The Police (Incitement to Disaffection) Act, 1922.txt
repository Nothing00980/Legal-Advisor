The Police (Incitement To Disaffection) Act, 1922
(22 of 1922)
151.
 


Statement of Objects and Reasons.-In view of the attempts that have been made and are being made (a) by means of threats, intimidation and otherwise to induce members of the police-force to refrain from doing their duty, and (b) to spread disaffection among them, the Government of India have for some time had under consideration the question of penalising such attempts. Neither the Indian Penal Code nor the Indian Police Act, 1861, contains provisions to meet this evil. A prosecution could doubtless in certain cases be instituted under section 29 of the Indian Police Act, 1861, read with the abetment sections of the Indian Penal Code, but section 29 of the Police Act was designed to meet ordinary breaches of discipline, and would not cover many dangerous forms of tampering with the police. Moreover, the maximum punishment permissible under that section, viz., three months' rigorous imprisonment is manifestly inadequate for serious offences of this nature. The Government of India are accordingly of opinion that the authorities should be given additional means of dealing with this form of crime, and it is proposed, therefore, to eiact the attached Bill, which has been framed on the lines of section 3 of the English Police Act of 1919 (9 and 10 Geo. V. Ch. 46).
An Act to provide a penalty for spreading disaffection among the police and for kindred offences.
Whereas it is expedient to penalize the spreading of disaffection among the police and other kindred offences; It is hereby enacted as follows:
