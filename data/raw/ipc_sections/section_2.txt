Punishment of offences committed within India.
Every person 1 shall be liable to punishment under this Code and not otherwise for
every act or omission contrary to the provisions thereof, of which he shall be guilty
within 11.[India] 12.[***]. 2
COMMENT—
This section deals with the intraterritorial operation of the Code. It makes the Code
universal in its application to every person in any part of India for every act or omission
contrary to the provisions of the Code.
Section 2 read with section 4 of the IPC, 1860 makes the provisions of the Code
applicable to the offences committed "in any place without and beyond" the territory of
India; (1) by a citizen of India or (2) on any ship or aircraft registered in India,
irrespective of its location, by any person not necessarily a citizen. Such a declaration
was made as long back as in 1898. By an amendment in 2009 to the said section, the
Code is extended to any person in any place "without and beyond the territory of India",
committing an offence targeting a computer resource located in India.13.
1. 'Every person'.—Every person is made liable to punishment, without distinction of
nation, rank, caste or creed, provided the offence with which he is charged has been
committed in some part of India. A foreigner who enters the Indian territories and thus,
accepts the protection of Indian laws virtually gives an assurance of his fidelity and
obedience to them and submits himself to their operation. It is no defence on behalf of
a foreigner that he did not know he was doing wrong, the act not being an offence in
his own country. A foreigner who commits an offence within India is guilty and can be
punished as such without any limitation as to his corporal presence in India at the
time.14. Indian Courts have jurisdiction against foreigners residing in foreign countries
but their acts connected with transaction or part of transaction arising in India.15.
[s 2.1] Corporate Criminal Liability
A company is liable to be prosecuted and punished for criminal offences. Although
there are earlier authorities to the fact that the corporation cannot commit a crime, the
generally accepted modern rule is that a corporation may be subject to indictment and
other criminal process although the criminal act may be committed through its agent.
The majority in the Constitution bench held that there is no immunity to the companies
from prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of offences for which
the punishment is mandatory imprisonment and fine.16. When imprisonment and fine is
prescribed as punishment the Court can impose the punishment of fine which could be
enforced against the company.17.
In CBI v Blue Sky Tie-up Pvt Ltd,18. the question again came up for consideration before
the Supreme Court and it was held that since the majority of the Constitution Bench
ruled in Standard Chartered Bank v Directorate of Enforcement [supra] that the company
can be prosecuted even in a case where the Court can impose substantive sentence as
also fine, and in such case only fine can be imposed on the corporate body, the contrary
view taken by the learned single Judge cannot be approved.
[s 2.2] Vicarious Liability.—
Indian Penal Code, save and except some matters does not contemplate any vicarious
liability on the part of a person. Commission of an offence by raising a legal fiction or
by creating a vicarious liability in terms of the provisions of a statute must be expressly
stated. The Managing Director or the Directors of the Company, thus, cannot be said to
have committed an offence only because they are holders of offices.19. Vicarious
liability of the Managing Director and Director would arise provided any provision exists
in that behalf in the statute. Statutes indisputably must contain provision fixing such
vicarious liabilities. Even for the said purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the
complainant to make requisite allegations which would attract the provisions
constituting vicarious liability.20. The provisions of the Essential Commodities Act,
1955, Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Employees' Provident Fund (Miscellaneous
Provision) Act, 1952, etc., have created such vicarious liability. It is interesting to note
that section 14A of the 1952 Act specifically creates an offence of criminal breach of
trust in respect of the amount deducted from the employees by the company. In terms
of the explanations appended to section 405 of the IPC, 1860 a legal fiction has been
created to the effect that the employer shall be deemed to have committed an offence
of criminal breach of trust. Whereas a person in charge of the affairs of the company
and in control thereof has been made vicariously liable for the offence committed by
the company along with the company but even in a case falling under section 406 of
the IPC, 1860 vicarious liability has been held to be not extendable to the Directors or
officers of the company.21.
There is no exception in favour of anyone in the Penal Code, but the following persons
are exempted from the jurisdiction of criminal Courts of every country:—
(a) Foreign Sovereigns.—The real principle on which the exemption, of every sovereign
from the jurisdiction of every Court, has been deduced is that the exercise of such
jurisdiction would be incompatible with his regal dignity—that is to say, with his
absolute independence of every superior authority.22.
(b) Diplomats.—United Nations Privileges and Immunities Act, 1947, and the Diplomatic
Relations (Vienna Convention) Act, 1972, gave certain diplomats, missions and their
member's diplomatic immunity even from criminal jurisdiction. The Diplomatic
Relations (Vienna Convention) Act had been enacted to give effect to the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961. The effect of section 2 of the Act is to give
the force of law in India to certain provisions set out in the Schedule to the Act.
A diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving
State. He shall also enjoy immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction except
in the case of:
(i) A real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the
receiving State, unless he holds it on behalf of the sending State for the
purposes of the mission;
(ii) An action relating to succession in which the diplomatic agent is involved as
executor, administrator, heir or legatee as a private person and not on behalf of
the sending State;
(iii) An action relating to any professional or commercial activity exercised by the
diplomatic agent in the receiving State outside his official functions.23. A
diplomatic agent is not obliged to give evidence as a witness.24. Privileges and
immunities are conferred on United Nations and its Representatives as well as
on other international organisations and their representatives by the United
Nations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, 1947.25.
(c) Alien enemies.—In respect of acts of war alien enemies cannot be tried by criminal
Courts. If an alien enemy commits a crime unconnected with war, e.g., theft, he would
be triable by ordinary criminal Courts.
(d) Foreign army.—When armies of one State are by consent on the soil of a foreign
State they are exempted from the jurisdiction of the State on whose soil they are.
(e) Warships.—Men-of-war of a State in foreign waters are exempt from the jurisdiction
of the State within whose territorial jurisdiction they are. The domestic Courts, in
accordance with principles of international law, will accord to the ship and its crew and
its contents certain immunities. The immunities can, in any case, be waived by the
nation to which the public ship belongs.26.
(f) President and Governors.—Under Article 361 of the Indian Constitution, the
President and Governors are exempt from the jurisdiction of Courts.
2. 'Within India'.—If the offence is committed outside India it is not punishable under
the Penal Code, unless it has been made so by means of special provisions such as
sections 3, 4, 108A, etc., of the Code. Under section179 of the Cr PC, 1973 even the
place(s) wherein the consequence (of the criminal act) "ensues" would be relevant to
determine the Court of competent jurisdiction. Therefore, even the Courts within whose
local jurisdiction, the repercussion/effect of the criminal act occurs, would have
jurisdiction in the matter. When the consequence of an act committed by a foreigner
outside India if ensued in India, he can be tried in India.27. Normally crime carries the
person. The commission of a crime gives the Court of the place where it is committed
jurisdiction over the person of the offender.28.
[s 2.3] Territorial jurisdiction.—
The territory of India is defined under Article 1 of the Constitution of India. Article 1 of
the Constitution of India deals only with the geographical territory while Article 297
deals with 'maritime territory'.
Article 297(3) authorises the Parliament to specify from time to time the limits of
various maritime zones such as, territorial waters, continental shelf, etc. Clauses (1)
and (2) of the said Article make a declaration that all lands, minerals and other things
of value and all other resources shall vest in the Union of India.29. Section 18 of the IPC,
1860 defines India as the territory of India excluding the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
These territorial limits would include the territorial waters of India.30. Under the General
Clauses Act, 1897, India is defined to mean all territories for the time being comprised
in the territory of India as defined in the Constitution of India. Under the provisions of
Article 297 of the Constitution of India, all lands, minerals and other things of value
underlying the ocean within the territorial waters or the continental shelf or the
exclusive economic zone of India vest in the Union. The Constitution of India does not
itself define the terms territorial waters, continental shelf, and exclusive economic
zone. Clause (3) of Article 297 states that their limits shall be such as may be specified
by Parliament. In 1976, Parliament implemented the amendments to the Constitution
of India by passing the Maritime Zones Act, 1976.31. Insofar the Republic of India is
concerned, the limit of the territorial waters was initially understood to be three nautical
miles. It had been extended subsequently; up to six nautical miles by a Presidential
proclamation dated 22 March 1952 and to 12 nautical miles by another proclamation
dated 30 September 1967. By The Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive
Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 80 of 1976, it was statutorily fixed at 12
nautical miles. Section 3 of the Act stipulates that the sovereignty of India extends to
the territorial waters, the limit of which is 12 nautical miles. Section 5 of the Territorial
Waters Act, 1976 defines the contiguous zone of India as an area beyond and adjacent
to territorial waters to a distance of 24 nautical miles from the nearest point of the
baseline. Section 7 of the Act defines the Exclusive economic zone of India as an area
beyond and adjacent to territorial waters up to a limit of 200 nautical miles.32.
[s 2.4] Jurisdiction beyond Territorial Waters
In the case of British India Steam Navigation Co Ltd v Shanmughavilas Cashew
Industries,33. the Supreme Court examined the effective operation of the statutes of a
country in relation to foreigners and foreign ships.
In general, a statute extends territorially, unless the contrary is stated, throughout the
country and will extend to the territorial waters, and such places as intention to that effect is
shown. A statute extends to all persons within the country if that intention is shown. The
Indian Parliament, therefore, has no authority to legislate for foreign vessels or foreigners in
them on the high seas. Thus a foreign ship on the high seas, or her foreign owners or their
agents in a foreign country, are not deprived of rights by our statutory enactment expressed
in general terms unless it provides that a foreign ship entering an Indian port or territorial
waters and thus coming within the territorial jurisdiction is to be covered. Without anything
more Indian statutes are ineffective against foreign property and foreigners outside the
jurisdiction.
It is this principle which is reflected in section 2(2) of the Merchant Shipping Act,
1958.34.
Earlier in Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore Ltd v UOI,35. it was held that India has been given
only certain limited sovereign rights and such limited sovereign rights conferred on
India in respect of continental shelf and exclusive economic zone cannot be equated to
extending the sovereignty of India over the continental shelf and exclusive economic
zone as in the case of territorial waters.
