COMMENT—
Under this section it is not necessary to either to cause hurt or even to make an
attempt to cause hurt. Mere preparation to cause hurt should the occasion arise e.g., to
affect his escape is enough to bring the accused within the mischief of this section.
One who keeping a knife with him commits theft may be liable under this section even
though there was no occasion to wield the knife or to cause injury.109.
If hurt is actually caused when a theft is committed, the offence is punishable as
robbery, and not under this section.110. In robbery there is always injury. In offences
under this section the thief is full of preparation to cause hurt but he may not cause it.
