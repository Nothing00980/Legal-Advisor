Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his
duty.
Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the
execution of his duty as such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that
person from discharging his duty as such public servant, or in consequence of
anything done or attempted to be done by such person in the lawful discharge of his
duty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to two years or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
The public servant must be acting in the discharge of a duty imposed by law on him in
the particular case, and the section will not protect him for an act done in good faith
under colour of his office.977. If hurt is caused under the circumstances mentioned in
the section then either section 332 or section 333 will apply.
[s 353.1] CASES.—Defect in warrant.—
It is made clear in the illustrations that the words alone will not amount to assault. So
also, the mere gesture of picking up a stick alone will not constitute assault unless
accompanied by other circumstances. The gesture explained by the words alone
amounts to assault. Therefore, mere preparation of carrying a weapon and standing
before the victim without making any gesture which will disclose the intention or
knowledge will not constitute assault. As seen from Illustration (c), mere carrying a
stick without being accompanied by a statement which will disclose the intention or
knowledge will not constitute assault. But there is nothing in evidence to reveal
commission of any of the overt acts to constitute offence under section 353 IPC, 1860.
The prosecution has failed to prove any of the offences alleged against appellants.978.
Resistance to an illegal order of attachment is not an offence under section 353, IPC,
1860.979. Where the accused allegedly assaulted the District Revenue Officer who
distributing flood relief in village and made an attempt to snatch the cash and evidence
of witnesses was found cogent, convincing and credit worthy, conviction was
upheld.980. Accused allegedly snatched the service revolver of complainant police
officer and fired at him. All the witnesses who were independent witnesses, turned
hostile. Offence under sections 307 and 353 was held not proved.981.
[s 353.2] Search without proper order or warrant.—
Where the accused resisted a public officer who attempted to search a house, in the
absence of a proper written order authorizing him to do so, he was held to have
committed no offence under this section.982. But the Madras High Court has held that
a search without a search warrant does not justify an obstruction or resistance to an
officer, if he was acting in good faith and without malice.983. Even though an illegal
search under section 165, Cr PC, 1973 can be resisted, yet there is no justification to
assault an officer after he has finished the search and left the house. Such an act
amounts to an offence under section 353 IPC, 1860.984. In this connection see also
sub-head "Cases" under section 340 ante.
[s 353.3] Public servant must be acting in execution of duty.—
Where the accused created hindrance in the discharge of duties of police in order to
avoid arrest, it was held that conviction under section 353 was justified.985. Where a
cart owner refused to give his cart for the use of a Forest Settlement Officer who
required it as per executive orders of Government, and assaulted the peon in preventing
him from seizing his cart, it was held that he could not be convicted of an offence
under this section, because the rules aforesaid had not the force of law, and a public
servant acting under them was not acting in the execution of his duty.986. Similarly,
where a forest officer who was authorised to arrest a person only when the offence
was committed within five miles of the border arrested the accused when there was no
evidence that the offence was committed within the five mile belt, it was held that the
arrest not being justified, the accused did not commit any offence under this section by
inflicting some injuries on the officer during a scuffle.987. Legality of the execution of
duty is the sine qua non for the application of section 353 IPC, 1860.988. Where a
Headmaster of a school was assaulted with a ruler by a fellow teacher out of previous
personal grudge and not due to any performance of public duty, it was held that the
accused could not be convicted under section 353 though his conviction under section
325, IPC, 1860 was legal as the Headmaster suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder
joint.989. In this connection see also comments under section 332 ante. Where the
Assistant Superintendent of Commercial Taxes paid a surprise visit to the shop of the
accused and took up some books of account maintained by the shop for inspection, as
he was empowered to do under the State's Sales Tax Law, and the accused snatched
away the books from him, it was held by the Supreme Court that the act of the accused
amounted to use of criminal force and he could be convicted under this section. It was
observed that to feel annoyed at this action of the accused would be the natural
reaction of the Assistant Superintendent.990. Where the driver of the Transport
Department prevented a Deputy Sarpanch from entering the bus through driver's cabin
and was kicked by the latter and thus suffered a grievous injury, it was held while
driving or standing by the bus the driver was on public duty and by stopping a trespass
into driver's cabin he was undoubtedly acting in the discharge of his duty as public
servant. The Deputy Sarpanch was, therefore, clearly liable under section 353, IPC,
1860.991.
Petitioner used vulgar and fitting language against complainant when he went to
petitioner's office to ask reason for not permitting him to mark his presence in
Attendance Register. It was held that act of petitioner cannot be defined to be an act in
discharge of official duty. There was no need of previous sanction to prosecute him.992.
[s 353.4] Posting adverse comments of social media site.—
The appellant posted adverse comments against the police officer on Facebook. The
threat must be with intention to cause alarm to the complainant to cause that person to
do or omit to do any work. Mere expression of any words without any intention to
cause alarm would not be sufficient to bring in the application of this section. But
material has to be placed on record to show that the intention is to cause alarm to the
complainant. Offence not made out.993.
[s 353.5] To deter public servant from discharging duty.—
Where the accused was asked by a sub-inspector to stop his car and he while
pretending to stop sped away and in this process hit the mudguard of the motor-cycle
on which the Sub-Inspector was sitting, it was held that the facts of the case did not
make out an offence of assault on a public servant or using criminal force so as to
deter him from discharging his duties as public servant.994. The accused suspected
that the complainant public servant was instrumental in his transfer. The complainant
was proceeding to his office to resume his duty. On the way he was assaulted by the
accused. It was held that no offence was committed under section 353 because the
public servant was not assaulted to deter him from discharge of his duty.995. The wife
of the accused was being taken to Police Station in execution of search warrant
accompanied by a police constable. The accused attacked his wife and also the police
constable. Conviction of the accused under section 353 was held to be proper, though
no injury as such was caused to the constable. The Court observed that actual causing
of injury is not necessary for conviction under section 353.996. In a complaint under
sections 323 and 329 the investigating Head Constable demanded bribe for arresting
some persons and was caught red-handed in a trap but on his call the villagers
attacked the raiding party and snatched away their belongings and currency notes used
in the trap, thus deterring the public servants from discharging their duties and
rescuing the accused from the lawful custody of the Inspector of the raiding party.
Conviction of the Head Constable under section 395 read with section 109, sections
353/109 and 224, the constable whom the head constable handed over the money
under section 395 and the villagers under sections 353, 149, 226 and 147 was
upheld.997. Four persons brought a woman to a room of a circuit house for the purpose
of prostitution. When one of them was busy in sexual intercourse and others were busy
in drinking, the police reached there and as they were about to arrest the accused, one
of the accused obstructed the police officers in discharge of their duties. The
conviction of that accused under section 353 was upheld.998.
[s 353.6] Section 353 vis-a-vis Section 186 IPC, 1860.—
There is an essential distinction between the offences punishable under sections 353
and 186 IPC, 1860. The ingredients of the two offences are distinct and different. While
the former is a cognizable offence, the latter is not. A mere obstruction or resistance
unaccompanied by criminal force or assault will not constitute an offence under
section 353 IPC, 1860. Where an accused voluntarily obstructs a public servant in the
discharge of his duties, section 186 IPC, 1860 is attracted. But under section 353, there
must be in addition to the obstruction use of criminal force or assault to the public
servant while he was discharging his duty. It may also be noted that the quality of the
two offences is also different. While section 186 occurs in Chapter X dealing with
contempt of the lawful authority of public servants, section 353 appears in Chapter XVI
which deals with offences affecting the human body. This is also a clear indication that
use of criminal force contemplated under section 353 IPC, 1860 is against a person
and not against any inanimate object.999.
