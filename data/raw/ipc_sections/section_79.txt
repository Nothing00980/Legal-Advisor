Punishment of person guilty of one of several offences, the judgment
stating that it is doubtful of which.
In all cases in which judgment is given that a person is guilty of one of several
offences specified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences,
he is guilty, the offender shall be punished for the offence for which the lowest
punishment is provided if the same punishment is not provided for all.
COMMENTâ€”
This provision is intended to prevent an offender whose guilt is fully established from
eluding punishment on the ground that the evidence does not enable the tribunal to
pronounce with certainty under what penal provision his case falls. The section applies
to cases in which the law applicable to a certain set of facts is doubtful. The doubt
must be as to which of the offences the accused has committed, not whether he has
committed any. Moreover, this rule would apply even if one of the alternatives were an
offence of murder.243.
