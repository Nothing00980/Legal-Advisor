Wrongful confinement for three or more days.
Whoever wrongfully confines any person for three days, or more, shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or
with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
Whoever wrongfully confines any person for three days or more shall be punished
under this section. Whoever wrongfully restrains any person in such a manner as to
prevent that person from proceeding beyond certain circumscribed limits is said to
'wrongfully confine' that person, as defined under section 340, IPC, 1860. Use of
physical force is not necessary for the offence of wrongful confinement. A mere
detention of a person against law would attract section 343, IPC, 1860.957.
[s 343.1] Sanction.—
Since illegal detention and the assault made against the first respondent by the
petitioner did not form part of the official duty of the petitioner and, therefore, there was
no necessity to obtain prior sanction under section 197, Cr PC, 1973.958.
