"Voluntarily.".
A person is said to cause an effect "voluntarily" when he causes it by means whereby
he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, he
knew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it.
ILLUSTRATION
A sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of facilitating
a robbery and thus causes the death of a person. Here, A may not have intended to
cause death; and may even be sorry that death has been caused by his act; yet, if he
knew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused death voluntarily.
COMMENTâ€”
Bare reading of this section shows that a person need not intend to cause a certain
effect. If an act is the probable consequence of the means used by him, he is said to
have caused it voluntarily whether he really means to cause it or not. Section implicitly
lays down the principle that a man is presumed to intend the probable consequences
of his act.276. Following this it has been held that if the accused was not aware that the
person whom they confined was a public servant, section 332 (voluntarily causing hurt
to deter public servant from his duty) would not be attracted. The accused would be
guilty of causing hurt under section 323.277. The Supreme Court has given a new
meaning to the word "voluntary" by holding in Olga Tellis v Bombay MC,278. that the act
of slum dwellers putting up their huts on public footpaths and pavements cannot be
described to be "voluntary" for the purposes of the definition of "criminal trespass" in
section 441, it being the result of utter helplessness and their moral right of survival.
