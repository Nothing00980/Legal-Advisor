Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.
Nothing which is done in pursuance of, or which is warranted by the judgment or order
of, a Court of Justice; if done whilst such judgment or order remains in force, is an
offence, notwithstanding the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such
judgment or order, provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the
Court had such jurisdiction.
COMMENT.â€”
This section is merely a corollary to section 77. It affords protection to officers acting
under the authority of a judgment, or order of a Court of Justice. It differs from section
77 on the question of jurisdiction. Here, the officer is protected in carrying out an order
of a Court which may have no jurisdiction at all, if he believed that the Court had
jurisdiction; whereas under section 77 the Judge must be acting within his jurisdiction
to be protected by it.
Mistake of law can be pleaded as a defence under this section.
