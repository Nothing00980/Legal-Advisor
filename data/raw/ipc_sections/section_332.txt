Whoever voluntarily causes grievous hurt for the purpose of extorting from the

security, or of constraining the sufferer or any person interested in such sufferer to do
anything that is illegal or which may facilitate the commission of an offence, shall be
punished with 855.[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.â€”
This section is similar to section 327, the only difference being that the hurt caused
under it is grievous.856. Where a grievous hurt was caused to obstruct the person from
deposing in Court, the Court said that it amounted to forcing him to commit an act
which was illegal. Framing of charge under the section was not improper.857. In this
provision the words "for the purposes of extorting" are most important to meet the
argument of learned counsel for appellant. This will include an attempt to extort also.
This provision would be attracted even if extortion is not complete. Section 329, IPC,
1860 deals with grievous hurt caused for the particular purpose that is extortion or
other purposes mentioned in the section. The offence of extortion may or may not have
been completed. Two appellants along with others attacked the complainant with
knives. Two appellants with one more, each stabbed the complainant. They were held
liable for each other's acts because they acted in concert to extort money.858.
