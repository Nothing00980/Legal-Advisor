The Charitable Endowments Act, 1890
(6 of 1890)
Last Updated 30th December, 2019
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-On many occasions the want has been felt in India of an official capable of discharging the functions which are discharged in England by the Official Trustee of Charity Lands and the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds. The object of this Bill is to meet that want.
2. Much property has from time to time in different parts of India been vested by founders in public servants, such as the Collector, Director of Public Instruction, Accountant-General and Divisional Commissioner. With respect to a case in which an Accountant-General and a Divisional Commissioner had been named as trustees, the Officiating Advocate-General of Bengal and the Officiating Standing Counsel stated in a joint opinion in 1885 that persons cannot as holders of certain posts, be appointed trustees "unless these posts are corporate ones". Neither the "office of the Accountant-General nor that of the Commissioner" they observed, "is a corporate office; and even if appointed by the designation of their office only, and not by name, the trust-fund would vest in them as individuals, and they would remain trustees until they themselves appointed others to succeed them or until they died".
3. There is a difficulty in India in finding any corporation capable of acting as a trustee in such cases as this Bill is designed to meet. The Secretary of State for India in Council and the Governor-General in Council are incapable of being trustees (L.R. 15 Ch. D. 9). It has also been held that Anglican Bishops and Archdeacons in India, who have been constituted by Letters Patent to the perpetual corporations, with power to take and hold property under grant or licence from the Crown, are not capable of acting as trustees in some of the cases for which this Bill is intended to provide. To the question whether the Lord Bishop of Calcutta in his corporate capacity might not, under the Letters Patent for the Bishopric of Calcutta, bearing date the 14th May, 1814, hold land upon trust for a Diocesan School so that, upon ceasing to be Bishop, it would devolve without a deed upon his successor in the Bishopric, an eminent counsel in England, to whom the question was referred, has replied in the negative. "It is quite true", he remarks, "that the Bishop is a corporation sole, and in that capacity can hold the lands belonging to his See. He may, however, only hold such lands as by grant or licence from the Company (now Her Majesty) he is authorised to take, hold and enjoy. I think it is clear that the Letters Patent only refer to land belonging to, or purchased out of moneys belonging to, the Bishopric....... on the whole. I am of opinion that, if the land in question was conveyed to the Bishop as a trustee, it would pass on his death not to his successor but to his executors".
4. The Bill, it will be observed, is of a purely permissive character. The Government will be unable to make a vesting order or frame a scheme except on application for that purpose, and may, if it sees fit, refuse to act. The corporation sole in whom as Treasurer of Charitable Endowments property may be vested is, except as regards the disposal of any property by direction of the Government, to have nothing to do with the administration of the property. He is to be a bare trustee, the object of vesting the property in him by his name of office as a corporation sole being to secure the holding of the property by some one always present, and to avoid the difficulty and expense of appointing a new trustee on the retirement or death of any incumbent of the trust".
Act 56 of 1982.- Section 13 of the Charitable Endowments Act, 1890 empowers  the appropriate Government to make rules consistent with the Act. The Act does not requires the rules so made by the appropriate Government to be published in the official gazette or laid before Parliament or the State Legislatures, as the case may be.
2. With a view to implementing the recommendations made by the Committees on Subordinate Legislation with respect to the publication and lying of rules and regulations, the Bill seeks to amend the said section to provide for the publication of the rules made thereunder in the official gazette and for the laying of such rules. Rules made by a State Government will have to be laid before the State Legislature, while rules made by the Central Government will have to be laid before Parliament.
