Abetment of suicide.
If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.—
Abetment of suicide is punishable under this section and attempt to commit suicide,
under section 309.
[s 306.1] Ingredients.—
The ingredients of abetment of suicide are as follows:
The prosecution has to prove—
(i) the deceased committed suicide;
(ii) the accused instigated or abetted the commission of suicide;
(iii) direct involvement by the accused in such abetment or instigation is
necessary.577. In Ramesh Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh,578. the Supreme Court
held that where the accused by his acts or by a continued course of conduct
creates such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option but
to commit suicide, an "instigation" may be inferred. In other words, in order to
prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to be
established that
(a) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds
or wilful omission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the
deceased reacted or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words
or wilful omission or conduct to make the deceased move forward more
quickly in a forward direction, and
(b) that the accused had the intention to provoke, urge or encourage the
deceased to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above.
Undoubtedly, presence of mens rea is the necessary concomitant of
instigation.
Relevantly, it may be mentioned that there is a marked difference between
"intimidatory" statement and "instigatory" statement. "Intimidatory" statements may
give rise to two types of consequences, (a) either the person to whom such statements
are made may be frightened and may be on receiving end or he may be angry enough
to retaliate, whereas (b) instigatory statements falls within the category of goading,
provoking, etc.579. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or
intentionally aiding a person in doing a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the
accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.580.
[s 306.2] The scope and ambit of section 107 IPC, 1860 and its co-relation
with section 306 IPC, 1860.—
Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a
person in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate
or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.581. The intention and
involvement of the accused to aid or instigate the commission of suicide is imperative.
Any severance or absence of any of this constituents would militate against this
indictment. Remoteness of the culpable acts or omissions rooted in the intention of the
accused to actualise the suicide would fall short as well of the offence of abetment
essential to attract the punitive mandate of section 306, IPC, 1860. Contiguity,
continuity, culpability and complicity of the indictable acts or omission are the
concomitant indices of abetment. Section 306 IPC, thus criminalises the sustained
incitement for suicide.582. In the case of M Mohan v State,583. the Apex Court held that
there should be some live link, or a proximate link between the act of the accused and
the act of committing of suicide. If the live link is missing, it cannot be said that the
accused has instigated, or intentionally aided the commission of suicide. Mere threats
of involving the family in a false and frivolous cases cannot be tantamount to
instigation.584.
Words uttered in a fit of anger or emotion without any intention could not be regarded
as an instigation.585. A type of active role which can be described as amounting to
instigation or aiding for doing something is requisite before a person can be said to
have committed the offence under the section.586.
[s 306.3] What, if the abetted survives.—
The Supreme Court in Satvir Singh v State of Punjab,587. explained this particular
situation and held that a person can be convicted only when the abetted person
commits suicide. If it ends in an attempt, the abetter cannot be convicted. It is possible
to abet the commission of suicide. But nobody would abet a mere attempt to commit
suicide. It is also inconceivable to have abetment of an abetment. Hence, there cannot
be an offence under section 116 read with section 306, IPC, 1860.
[s 306.4] Maltreatment of wife.—
Mere stray instances of quarrel between husband and wife or the evidence that at
times the appellant used to consume liquor cannot be termed as abetment as defined
under section 107 IPC, 1860. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the
accused/appellant instigated or abetted the deceased to end her life and that being the
position his conviction under section 306 IPC, 1860 is not justified, and therefore, liable
to be set aside.588. Where husband maltreating and beating wife for not conceiving and
wife committed suicide, husband is liable to be convicted under section 306.589. The
accused husband, a drunkard, always ill-treated his wife, beat her and imputed
unchastity. The wife in a quarrel set herself ablaze and died. The husband along with
others attempted to stamp out flames. The conviction of the accused for murder was
set aside and he was convicted under section 306.590.
[s 306.5] Vicious habits like drinking and gambling and beating wife.—
The wife of the accused poured kerosene oil on herself and set herself ablaze. In her
dying declaration she said that her husband used to take liquor after borrowing money
from villagers and beat her after taking liquor. The Court said that this in itself did not
amount to abetment.591. The statement in the dying declaration was that the husband
used to get drunk, beat her and consistently abuse her. He also told her that he did not
bother if she lived or died and asked her to die. The Court held that this did not mean
that the accused intended to lead her to commit suicide. The offence of abetment was
not made out.592.
[s 306.6] Extra-marital relationship.—
Extra-marital relationship as such is not defined in the IPC, 1860. The mere fact that the
husband has developed some intimacy with another, during the subsistence of
marriage and failed to discharge his marital obligations, as such would not amount to
"cruelty", but it must be of such a nature as is likely to drive the spouse to commit
suicide to fall within the explanation to section 498A, IPC, 1860. Court, on facts, found
that the alleged extra-marital relationship was not of such a nature as to drive the wife
to commit suicide.593.
It has been held that the creation of circumstances for the victim to commit suicide
amounts to abetment. In this case, the deceased husband felt humiliated at the
activities of indulgence of his wife with the accused. The accused openly spoke of his
relationship with the wife of the deceased. The outrageous acts of the accused drove
the deceased to suicide. The accused was held to be guilty of abetting suicide.594.
[s 306.7] Failure to appear at arranged marriage, no abetment.—
The accused settled marriage ceremony date with the girl with whom he was in love
affair but did not turn up. The girl committed suicide. It was not proved that the
accused intended to lead her to suicide by not marrying or knew that suicide was a
likely consequence. It being an independent act of the victim girl, the accused was
acquitted.595.
[s 306.8] Pressure for repayment of loan.—
Where the accused had lent a certain amount to a lady and he was persistently
demanding repayment from her, which was no offence, the accused did not know that
she had purchased poisonous tablets and might commit suicide, he was held not liable
for abetment of suicide.596.
[s 306.9] Pressure for accounting proceeds—importance of suicide note.—
The deceased was the owner of a finance firm. The accused joined as a partner of the
group of persons who owned land. The deceased sold the plots and handed over
proceeds to the accused who neither handed over the money to the group nor effected
transfer in favour of purchasers. The latter pressurised the deceased as a result of
which he committed suicide.
This fact figured in the suicide note. The Court attached importance to this fact and
held the accused guilty of causing abetment.597.
[s 306.10] Pressure for parting with streedhan.—
The accused was forcing his wife to transfer the land to his name which she had
received as a part of her streedhan from her father. He concealed her letters. These
facts drove her to suicide. He was convicted under section 498A for the offence of
cruelty. On the same evidence he was convicted under section 306 read with section
221, Cr PC, 1973.598.
[s 306.11] Demand for recruitment money.—
A demand for a sum of money for recruitment in a job does not amount to instigating
suicide.599.
[s 306.12] Advice.—
Instigation necessarily indicates some active suggestion or support or stimulation to
the commission of the act itself, and advice can become an instigation only if it is
found that it was an advice which was meant actively to suggest or stimulate the
commission of an offence.600. Following this, it was held that where two persons were
in love with a married woman and quarrelled over her and one of them (the accused)
along with the lady taunted the other to commit suicide. The frustration thus caused
led him to suicide. It was held that no fault could be found with cognizance of the
offence under section 306.601.
[s 306.13] Abetment by defamation.—
The publication of a defamatory article against the victim was held to be not sufficient
abetment for leading the victim to suicide.602.
[s 306.14] Abetment by rape.—
The Supreme Court examined the possibility of such an abetment, but there was no
punishment because the incident of rape itself could not be proved. The suicide was
committed by the woman more than five and a half months after the incident. Her
statements could not be regarded as dying declaration because there were no
circumstances at the time which were related with her death. There was delay in
lodging FIR and also in conducting medical examination. There was no evidence to
connect the accused with the crime. The cause for commission of suicide was not
legally proved.603. Where the suicide was allegedly committed because of rape, if the
rape is not proved, conviction of accused for abetment to suicide is not proper.604.
[s 306.15] Instigation from Superior officers.—
In Madan Mohan Singh v State of Gujarat,605. the deceased was a driver in the
Microwave Project Department. He had undergone a bypass surgery for his heart, just
before the occurrence of such incident and his doctor had advised him against
performing any stressful duties. The accused was a superior officer to the deceased.
When the deceased failed to comply with the orders of the accused, the accused
became very angry and threatened to suspend the deceased, rebuking him very harshly
for not listening to him. The accused also asked the deceased how he still found the
will to live, despite being insulted so the driver committed suicide. For the purpose of
bringing home any charge, vis-à-vis section 306/107 IPC, 1860 against the accused,
Supreme Court stated that there must be allegations to the effect that the accused had
either instigated the deceased in some way, to commit suicide or had engaged with
some other persons in a conspiracy to do so, or that the accused had in some way
aided any act or illegal omission to cause the said suicide. If the making of
observations by a superior officer, regarding the work of his subordinate, is termed as
abetment to suicide, it would become almost impossible, for superior officers to
discharge their duties as senior employees. In Vaijnath Kondiba Khandke v State of
Maharashtra,606. action was taken against the deceased and his salary was stopped for
a month. The Supreme Court held that merely on that count it cannot be said that there
was guilty mind or criminal intent to drive a person to commit suicide. That action
simplicitor cannot be considered to be pointer against such superior officer for
attracting section 306 IPC, 1860, unless the situation is created deliberately so as to
drive a person to commit suicide.
[s 306.16] Instigation by principal/Teachers.—
Student committed suicide, because the Principal scolded, hit and asked him to
apologise before students in the assembly, when gutka pouches were recovered from
his bag. Even if these allegations are taken as unrebutted facts even then there is no
evidence to show that the petitioner had instigated or intentionally aided the
commission of suicide.607. Accused, supervisor of school gave beatings to deceased
student for sitting on his scooter. The deceased on account of the above incident had
committed suicide. Even if it is true that accused had beaten the deceased, it could not
be said that it was an act of attempt to commit suicide or instigating the commission
of suicide by deceased.608.
[s 306.17] Failure to provide plot after taking money.—
The allegation against the accused was that he had taken money from the deceased
for providing him a plot of land but refused to do so and that led to the commission of
suicide. There was no evidence to the effect that the accused goaded or urged, or
provoked or incited or even encouraged the commission of suicide. The Court said that
the mere failure to fulfil the promise concerning a plot of land was not sufficient for
satisfying the ingredients of section 306.609.
[s 306.18] 304B and 306 IPC, 1860.—Difference.—
It has been held that cruelty or harassment sans demand of dowry which drives the
wife to commit suicide attracts the offence of abetment of suicide under section 306
IPC, 1860.610.
[s 306.19] Sentence under sections 306 and 498A.—
The Calcutta High Court observed that composite sentence for conviction under both
the sections should not be passed.611.
[s 306.20] Proof.—
Instigation has to be gathered from the circumstances of the case. All cases may not
be of direct evidence in regard to instigation having a direct nexus to the suicide. There
could be cases where the circumstances created by the accused are such that a
person feels totally frustrated and finds it difficult to continue existence.612. In Chitresh
Kumar Chopra v State (Govt of NCT of Delhi),613. the Supreme Court reiterated the legal
position laid down in its earlier three Judges Bench judgment in the case of Ramesh
Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh,614. and held that where the accused by his acts or
continued course of conduct creates such circumstances that the deceased was left
with no other option except to commit suicide, an instigation may be inferred. In order
to prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to be
established that:—
(i) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds or wilful
omission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the deceased
reacted; or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words or wilful omission
or conduct to make the deceased move forward more quickly in a forward
direction; and
(ii) that the accused had the intention to provoke urge or encourage the deceased
to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above. Undoubtedly,
presence of mens rea is the necessary concomitant of instigation.615.
[s 306.21] Burden of Proof.—
The effect of these new provisions on the matter of burden of proof is amply
demonstrated by the decision of the Supreme Court in Gurbachan Singh v Satpal
Singh.616. The bride died in her in-laws' home within seven months of her marriage.
Evidence ruled out accidental death thus confirming the prosecution version of suicide.
As to the question of instigation, Ray J, proceeded as follows:617.
The prosecution witnesses clearly testified to the greedy and lustful nature of the husband
and others in that they persistently taunted the deceased and tortured her for not having
brought sufficient dowry from her father. It is also in evidence that they taunted her for
carrying an illegitimate child. All this … caused depression in her mind and drove her to take
the extreme step of putting an end to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on person and
setting it afire. Circumstantial evidence (unaccounted delay in providing treatment and
informing her parents living not far away) and the evidence of prosecution witnesses clearly
proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons instigated and abetted Ravinder
Kaur. The findings arrived at by the High Court without considering the circumstantial
evidence as well as the evidence of prosecution witnesses cannot be sustained. As such
the findings of the High Court are liable to be reversed and set aside.
The Supreme Court has reiterated in Wazir Chand v State of Haryana618. that before
section 306 can be acted upon, there must be clear proof of the fact that the death in
question was a suicidal death. In this case the evidence adduced was not able to justify
a finding of suicide. The only other possibility was accidental burning of the newly-
married woman though she was being victimised for insufficient dowry and there is no
chance of an accident being abetted. The husband and in-laws were, however, found
guilty under section 498A for causing harassment for dowry.
[s 306.22] Section 113A of Indian Evidence Act, 1872.—
Section 113A was inserted by the Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 1983, w.e.f.
26 December 1983. When death takes place within seven years of her marriage,
presumption under section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 springs into action.
When the question is whether the commission of suicide by a woman had been abetted
by her husband or any relative of her husband and it is shown that she had committed
suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that her
husband or such relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the Court may
presume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the case, that such suicide
had been abetted by her husband or by such relative of her husband.619. Section 113A
only deals with a presumption which the Court may draw in a particular fact situation
which may arise when necessary ingredients in order to attract that provision are
established. Criminal law amendment and the rule of procedure was necessitated so
as to meet the social challenge of saving the married woman from being ill-treated or
forcing to commit suicide by the husband or his relatives, demanding dowry.
Legislative mandate of the section is that when a woman commits suicide within seven
years of her marriage and it is shown that her husband or any relative of her husband
had subjected her to cruelty as per the terms defined in section 498A IPC, 1860, the
Court may presume having regard to all other circumstances of the case that such
suicide has been abetted by the husband or such person. Though a presumption could
be drawn, the burden of proof of showing that such an offence has been committed by
the accused under section 498A, IPC, 1860 is on the prosecution.620.
Once the prosecution succeeds in establishing the component of cruelty leading to a
conviction under section 498A, in our view only in a rare case, the Court can refuse to
invoke the presumption of abetment, if other requirements of section 113A of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stand satisfied.621.
[s 306.23] Constitutional validity.—
The scope of the pronouncement of the Apex Court that attempt to commit suicide is
ultra vires the Constitution does not make the offence of abetment to commit suicide
ultra vires the Constitution because the former is volitional and well-planned act of the
person concerned whereas the latter is on the different footing as therein a third person
forces the other person to take his life by committing suicide.622. The Constitutional
validity of section 306 (abetment of suicide) has been upheld in a decision of the
Bombay High Court also.623. Section 306 constitutes an entirely independent offence.
It is based on this principle of public policy that nobody should involve himself in, or
instigate or aid, the commission of a crime. It is not violative of Article 14 or 21 of the
Constitution.
[s 306.24] Abetment of attempt to commit Suicide.—
Section 306 prescribes punishment for abetment of suicide while section 309 punishes
attempt to commit suicide. Abetment of attempt to commit suicide is outside the
purview of section 306 and it is punishable only under section 309 and read with
section 107 IPC, 1860.624. A conviction in terms of section 107 IPC, 1860 is not
sustainable on mere allegation of harassment without any positive action in proximity
to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused that led a person to commit
suicide. A casual remark that is likely to cause harassment in ordinary course of things
will not come within the purview of instigation. A mere reprimand or a word in a fit of
anger will not earn the status of abetment. There has to be positive action that creates
a situation for the victim to put an end to life.625.
[s 306.25] Euthanasia.—
Assisted suicide and assisted attempt to commit suicide are made punishable for
cogent reasons in the interest of society. Such a provision is considered desirable to
also prevent the danger inherent in the absence of such a penal provision. The
Constitution Bench in Gian Kaur v State of Punjab,626. held that both euthanasia and
assisted suicide are not lawful in India which overruled the two Judge Bench decision
of the Supreme Court in P Rathinam v UOI.627. The Court held that the right to life under
Article 21 of the Constitution does not include the right to die. But in Aruna Ramchandra
Shanbaug v UOI,628. the Supreme Court held that passive euthanasia can be allowed
under exceptional circumstances under the strict monitoring of the Court.629.
