COMMENTâ€”
An oath is a religious asseveration, by which a person renounces the mercy, and
imprecates the vengeance of heaven, if he does not speak the truth.330. The form of
oath differs according to the religious persuasion of the swearer. A Christian swears on
the Bible, a Jew upon the Pentateuch, a Mahommedan upon the Koran, and a Hindu on
the Gita. A Hindu or a Mahommedan has the statutory right to be affirmed instead of
taking an oath.
