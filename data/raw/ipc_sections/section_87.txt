Act done by a person justified or by mistake of fact believing himself
justified, by law.
Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law1, or who by
reason of a mistake of fact2 and not by reason of a mistake of law3 in good faith,
believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it.
ILLUSTRATION
A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his
judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of
apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper
authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in
self-defence.
COMMENT.—
Distinction between Sections 76 and 79.—The distinction between section 76 and this
section is that in the former a person is assumed to be bound, and in the latter to be
justified, by law; in other words, the distinction is between a real or supposed legal
obligation and a real or supposed legal justification, in doing the particular act. Under
both (these sections) there must be a bona fide intention to advance the law,
manifested by the circumstances attending the act which is the subject of charge; and
the party accused cannot allege generally that he had a good motive, but must allege
specifically that he believed in good faith that he was bound by law (section 76) to do
as he did, or that being empowered by law (section 79) to act in the matter, he had
acted to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith.14.
1. Any person who is justified by law.—Jurisprudentially viewed, an act may be an
offence, definitionally speaking but a forbidden act may not spell inevitable guilt if the
law itself declares that in certain special circumstances it is not to be regarded as an
offence. The chapter on General Exceptions operates in this province. Section 79
makes an offence a non-offence. When? Only when the offending act is actually
justified by law or is bona fide believed by mistake of fact to be so justified.15. It is easy
to see that if the act complained of is wholly justified by law, it would not amount to an
offence at all in view of the provisions of section 79 of the IPC, 1860. Many cases may
however arise wherein acting under the provisions of the Police Act or other law
conferring powers on the police, the police officer or some other person may go beyond
what is strictly justified in law. Though section 79 of the IPC, 1860 will have no
application to such cases, section 53 of the Police Act will apply. But section 53 applies
to only a limited class of persons. So, it becomes the task of the Court, whenever any
question whether this section applies or not arises to bestow particular care on its
decision. In doing this it has to ascertain first, what act is complained of and then to
examine, if there is any provision of the Police Act or other law conferring powers on
the police, under which it may be said to have been done or intended to be done. The
Court has to remember in this connection that an act is not "under" a provision of law
merely because the point of time at which it is done coincides with the point of time
when some act is done in the exercise of the powers granted by the provision or in
performance of the duty imposed by it. To be able to say that an act is done "under" a
provision of law, one must discover the existence of a reasonable relationship between
the provisions and the act. In the absence of such a relation the act cannot be said to
be done "under" the particular provision of law.16. But unless there is a reasonable
connection between the act complained of and the powers and duties of the office, it
cannot be said that the act was done by the accused officer under the colour of his
office.17. In Bhanuprasad Hariprasad Dave's case,18. wherein the allegations against the
police officer was of taking advantage of his position and attempting to coerce a
person to give him a bribe. The plea of colour of duty was negatived by the Supreme
Court. In Prof. Sumer Chand v UOI, 1994 (1) SCC 64 [LNIND 1993 SC 665] Supreme
Court on facts endorsed the opinion of the High Court that the act of the Police Officer
complained of fell within the description of `colour of duty'. The argument is irresistible
that if the performance of the act which constitutes the offence is justified by law, i.e.,
by some other provision, then section 79 exonerates the doer because the act ceases
to be an offence. Likewise, if the act were done by one 'who by reason of a mistake of
fact in good faith believes himself to be justified by law in doing it' then also, the
exception operates and the bona fide belief, although mistaken, eliminates the
culpability. If the offender can irrefutably establish that he is actually justified by law in
doing the act or, alternatively, that he entertained a mistake of fact and in good faith
believed that he was justified by law in committing the act, then, the weapon of section
79 demolishes the prosecution.19.
2. 'Mistake of fact'.—Under this section, although an act may not be justified by law, yet
if it is done under a mistake of fact, in the belief in good faith that it is justified by law it
will not be an offence. Such cases are not uncommon where the Courts in the facts
and circumstances of the particular case have exonerated the accused under section
79 on the ground of having acted in good faith under the belief, owing to a mistake of
fact that he was justified in doing the act which constituted an offence. As laid down in
section 52 of the IPC, 1860, nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is
done or believed without due care and attention. The question of good faith must be
considered with reference to the position of the accused and the circumstances under
which he acted. 'Good faith' requires not logical infallibility but due care and attention.
The question of good faith is always a question of fact to be determined in accordance
with the proved facts and circumstances of each case.20.
'Mistake' is not mere forgetfulness.21. It is a slip "made, not by design, but by
mischance."22. Under sections 76 and 79 a mistake must be one of fact and not of law.
At common law an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances,
which, if true, would make the act for which a prisoner is indicted an innocent act has
always been held to be a good defence. Honest and reasonable mistake stands in fact
on the same footing as absence of the reasoning faculty, as in infancy, or perversion of
that faculty, as in lunacy.23. It may be laid down as a general rule that an alleged
offender is deemed to have acted under that state of facts which he in good faith and
on reasonable grounds believed to exist when he did the act alleged to be an
offence.24. Ignorantia facti doth excusat, for such ignorance many times makes the act
itself morally involuntary.25. Where a man made a thrust with a sword at a place where,
upon reasonable grounds, he supposed a burglar to be, and killed a person who was
not a burglar, it was held that he had committed no offence.26. In other words, he was
in the same situation as far as regards the homicide as if he had killed a burglar. The
accused while guarding his maize field shot an arrow at a moving object in the bona
fide belief that it was a bear and in the process caused the death of a man who was
hiding there. It was held that he could not be held liable for murder as his case was
fully covered by section 79 as well as section 80 IPC, 1860.27. Similarly, where the
accused while helping the police stopped a cart which they in good faith believed to be
carrying smuggled rice but ultimately their suspicion proved to be incorrect, it was held
that they could not be prosecuted for wrongful restraint under section 341 as their case
was covered by section 79 IPC, 1860.28. Section 79 makes an offence a non-offence.
Thus, where the Board of Censors, acting within their jurisdiction and on an application
made and pursued in good faith sanctions the public exhibition of a film, the producer
and the connected agencies do enter the statutory harbour and are protected from
prosecution under section 292 IPC, 1860, because section 79 of the Code exonerates
them at least in view of their bona fide belief that the certificate is justificatory.29.
3. 'Mistake of law'.—Mistake in point of law in a criminal case is no defence. Mistake of
law ordinarily means mistake as to the existence or otherwise of any law on a relevant
subject as well as mistake as to what the law is.30.
Ignorance of the municipal law of the Kingdom, or of the penalty thereby inflicted upon
offenders, doth not excuse any, that is of the age of discretion and compos mentis, from the
penalty of the breach of it; because every person of the age of discretion and compos
mentis is bound to know the law, and presumed so to do.31.
If any individual should infringe the statute law of the country through ignorance or
carelessness, he must abide by the consequences of his error; it is not competent to
him to aver in a Court of Justice that he was ignorant of the law of the land, and no
Court of Justice is at liberty to receive such a plea.32.
The maxim ignorantia juris non excusat, in its application to criminal offences, admits of
no exception, not even in the case of a foreigner who cannot reasonably be supposed
in fact to know the law of the land.33. The legal presumption that everyone knows the
law of the land is often untrue as a matter of fact. But then why such a presumption
subsists? The reason for this seems to be nothing but expediency; otherwise there is
no knowing of the extent to which the excuse of ignorance of law might be carried.
Indeed, it might be urged almost in every case.34. This rule of expediency has been put
to use even in a case where the accused could not have possibly known the law in the
circumstances in which he was placed. Thus, a person who was on the high seas and
as such could not have been cognizant of a recently passed law might be convicted for
contravening it.35.
Whenever the question of justification of an offence either due to mistake of fact or
mistake of law arises, the guiding rules are: (1) that when an act is in itself plainly
criminal, and is more severely punishable if certain circumstances co-exist, ignorance
of the existence of such circumstances is no answer to a charge for the aggravated
offence. (2) That where an act is prima facie innocent and proper, unless certain
circumstances co-exist, then ignorance of such circumstances is an answer to the
charge. (3) That the state of the defendant's mind must amount to absolute ignorance
of the existence of the circumstance which alters the character of the act, or to a belief
in its non-existence. (4) Where an act which is in itself wrong is, under certain
circumstances, criminal, a person who does the wrong act cannot set up as a defence
that he was ignorant of the facts which turned the wrong into a crime. (5) Where a
statute makes it penal to do an act under certain circumstances, it is a question upon
the wording and object of the particular statute, whether the responsibility of
ascertaining that the circumstances exist is thrown upon the person who does the act
or not. In the former case his knowledge is immaterial.36.
[s 79.1] Ignorance of statute newly passed.—
Although a person commits an act which is made an offence for the first time by a
statute so recently passed as to render it impossible that any notice of the passing of
the statute could have reached the place where the offence has been committed, yet
his ignorance of the statute will not save him from punishment.37. For an Indian law to
operate and be effective in the territory where it operates namely, the territory of India, it
is not necessary that it should either be published, or be made known outside the
country.38.
[s 79.2] Act of State.—
An act of State is an act injurious to the person or to the property of some person who
is not at the time of that act a subject of the Government; which act is done by any
representative of the Government's authority, civil or military, and is either previously
sanctioned or subsequently ratified by the Government. The doctrine as to acts of State
can apply only to acts which affect foreigners, and which are done by the orders or with
the ratification of the Government. As between the State and its subjects there can be
no such thing as an act of State. Courts of law are established for the express purpose
of limiting public authority in its conduct towards individuals.
Persons carrying out an act of State under proper orders will be protected by the Penal
Code, in the same way as if they were carrying out a lawful order under the municipal
law. To support a plea of this nature two things are essential:—
(1) that the defendant had authority to act on behalf of the State in the matter; and
(2) that in so acting, he was professing to act as a matter of policy, outside the law,
and not as a matter of right within the law.
[s 79.3] Protection of private persons.—
Private persons acting under sections 38, 43, 72 and 73 of the Cr PC, 1973 will be
protected under this section.
[s 79.4] Fake Encounters. —
Unprovoked firing by appellants who were police officials caused death of two persons
and grievous gun-shot injuries to another person. Seven police officers admitted firing
into the vehicle. But the defence case was that they had done so only on the direction
of ACP, a superior officer. The Supreme Court held that it cannot, by any stretch of
imagination, be claimed by anybody that a case of murder would fall within the
expression 'colour of duty'.39.
[s 79.5] CASES.—Mistake of fact.—
Good Defence.—Where an accused owing to a defect in his vision and the effect of a
fall bona fide believed that his son of whom he was very fond was a tiger and caused
fatal injuries to him with an axe in a moment of delusion, he was protected under this
section, and his act being done under a bona fide mistake, he could not be convicted of
an offence of murder.40. Once the Board of Censors, acting within their jurisdiction and
on an application made and pursued in good faith, sanctions the public exhibition of a
film, the producer and connected agencies enter the statutory harbour and are
protected because section 79 exonerates them in view of the bona fide belief that the
certificate is justificatory.41.
[s 79.6] English case.—
The accused was convicted of bigamy, having gone through the ceremony of marriage
within seven years after she had been deserted by her husband. She believed in good
faith and on reasonable grounds that her husband was dead. It was held that a bona
fide belief on reasonable grounds in the death of the husband at the time of the second
marriage afforded a good defence to the indictment, and that the conviction was
wrong.42. Where the question was whether the accused was to be held liable for
injuring a person whom he thought was belabouring another when in fact he was only
trying to immobilise a person who had attempted to rob a woman, the Court said that if
W was labouring under a mistake of fact as to the circumstances when he committed
the alleged offence, he was to be judged according to his mistaken view of the facts
regardless of whether his mistake was reasonable or unreasonable. The
reasonableness or otherwise of the belief was only material to the question of whether
the belief was in fact held by the defendant at all.43.
[s 79.7] Bad defence.—
Deceased attempted to steal coconut from the garden of which accused was a
watchman. Accused contended that, he while discharging his duties as a watchman in
good faith and under mistake of fact inflicted an injury which unfortunately resulted in
the death of the victim. Explaining the applicability of section 79, Supreme Court held
that there was no mistake of fact which could even if existed or found true could
warrant or justify in law, the imposition of such a serious injury as found inflicted on the
victim.44. A police-officer saw a horse tied up in B's premises and because it happened
to resemble one which his father had lost a short time previously, he jumped at once to
the conclusion that B had either stolen the horse himself, or purchased it from the thief,
and compelled B to account for his possession. The officer found that B had bought
the animal from one S; so he sent for S, charged him with the theft, and compelled him
to give bail whilst an investigation was pending. The officer never sent for the
supposed owner of the horse, or took the trouble of getting any credible information as
to whether it was his father's horse or not. It was held that the police-officer had not
acted in good faith, that is, with due care and attention and that this section did not
protect him.45. The accused struck a person with a full force lathi blow thinking that he
was a thief and he had to do so to safeguard his property. The incident took place
outside the house near a pond. The place was away from the house. There being no
occasion for private defence of property and the blow being given on the head with
severity, it was held that the accused was liable to be convicted under section 304 Part
II. He was sentenced to three years RI.46.
[s 79.8] English case.—
The accused took an unmarried girl under the age of 16 years out of the possession,
and against the will, of her father. The defence of the accused was that he was bona
fide and reasonably believed that the girl was older than 16. It was held that the taking
of the girl was unlawful the defence was bad.47. This case may be distinguished from
Tolson's case, in which a woman married believing her husband to be dead. There the
conduct of the woman was not in the smallest degree immoral, but was, on the other
hand, perfectly natural and legitimate.
