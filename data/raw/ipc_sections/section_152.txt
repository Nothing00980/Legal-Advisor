Joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon.
Whoever, being armed with any deadly weapon, or with anything which, used as a
weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, is a member of an unlawful assembly,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT—
Armed with deadly weapons.—This is an aggravated form of the offence mentioned in
the last section. The risk to public tranquillity is aggravated by the intention of using
force evinced by carrying arms. The enhanced punishment under this section can only
be inflicted on that member of an unlawful assembly who is armed with a weapon of
offence.
