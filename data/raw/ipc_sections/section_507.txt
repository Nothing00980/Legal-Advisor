State Amendment
Andhra Pradesh.— The offence is cognizable, non-bailable, triable by the Magistrate of
the first class and non-compoundable vide A.P. Act No. 3 of 1992, Section 2 (w.e.f. 15-2-
1992), in A.P.
COMMENT.—
This section punishes fraudulent or mock marriages.
It applies to cases in which a ceremony is gone through which would in no case
constitute a marriage, and in which one of the parties is deceived by the other into the
belief that it does constitute a marriage, or in which effect is sought to be given by the
proceeding to some collateral fraudulent purpose. Where the ceremony gone through
does, but for the previous marriage, constitutes a valid marriage, and both parties are
aware of the circumstances of the previous marriage, s. 494 applies.42.
[s 496.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires two essentials:—
1. Dishonestly or with a fraudulent intention going through the ceremony of marriage.
2. Knowledge on the part of the person going through the ceremony that he is not
thereby lawfully married.
[s 496.2] Sections 493 and 496.—
The two sections are somewhat alike: the difference appears to be that under section
493, deception is requisite on the part of the man, and cohabitation or sexual
intercourse consequent on such deception. The offence under section 496 requires no
deception, cohabitation, or sexual intercourse as a sine qua non, but a dishonest or
fraudulent abuse of the marriage ceremony. In the latter case the offence can be
committed by a man or woman, in the former, only by a man.
[s 496.3] Sections 494 and 496.—
An offence under section 494 is different from an offence under section 496, IPC, 1860.
If the accused intends that there should be valid marriage and honestly goes through
the necessary ceremonies during the lifetime of the other spouse, then it may be a case
under section 494, IPC, 1860, but if the accused only intends that there should only be a
show of marriage and dishonestly and fraudulently goes through the marriage
ceremony knowing fully well that he is not legally married thereby, then it is an offence
under section 496, IPC, 1860.43.
[s 496.4] CASE.—
Where the accused married for the second time during the pendency of special appeal
against decree of divorce in violation of section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 but
without concealing the fact of pendency of the appeal from the girl or her parents, no
conviction could be entered under section 496, IPC, 1860 as the act of the accused was
neither dishonest nor fraudulent.44.
