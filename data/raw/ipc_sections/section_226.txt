Escape from confinement or custody negligently suffered by public
servant.
Whoever, being a public servant legally bound as such public servant to keep in
confinement any person charged with 347.[or convicted of any offence or lawfully
committed to custody], negligently suffers such person to escape from confinement,
shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two
years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This section further extends the principle laid down in the two preceding sections. It
punishes a public servant who negligently suffers any person charged with an offence
to escape from confinement. The last two sections deal with intentional omission to
apprehend such person.
[s 223.1] Ingredients.—
In order to establish the charge under section 223, IPC, 1860 the following facts have to
be established:—
(i) The accused was a public servant.
(ii) As such public servant he was bound to keep in confinement any person.
(iii) Such person was charged with or convicted of an offence or lawfully committed
to custody.
(iv) The accused suffered such person to escape.
(v) The escape was due to the negligence of the public servant.348.
[s 223.2] Lawful custody.—
Unless the custody is lawful no offence under this section is committed. If a public
servant has no right to keep a person in custody, he is not guilty of allowing that person
to escape.349. Since the check post officer appointed under section 41(2) Bihar Sales
Tax Act had no power to detain personnel or driver of a truck which contravened the
provisions of the Act, he could not be prosecuted for an offence under section 223, IPC,
1860, for allowing detained person to escape especially because section 223 speaks of
"confinement of persons charged with or convicted of any offence or lawfully
committed to custody". Even assuming that such a check post officer could detain a
person, still he could not be prosecuted as detention was not synonymous with
confinement nor the persons escaping were charged or convicted of any offence.350. A
constable who moved about in a market place with the prisoner whom he was
supposed to bring to the Court and he escaped, the case was held to be fit one for
imposing substantive punishment.351.
This section applies only to cases where the person who is allowed to escape is in
custody for an offence, or has been committed to custody, and not to cases where
such person has merely been arrested under a civil process.352. The latter case would
come under section 225A. Due to the negligence and carelessness of the police
constable one accused escaped from police lock-up. It is proved that the petitioner was
on duty at lock-up room when the accused escaped. Conviction is held proper.353.
