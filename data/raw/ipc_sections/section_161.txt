Wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot—.
Whoever malignantly,1 or wantonly,2 by doing anything which is illegal, gives
provocation to any person intending or knowing it to be likely that such provocation
will cause the offence of rioting to be committed, shall, if the offence of rioting be
committed in consequence of such provocation, be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both;
if rioting be committed;if not committed.
and if the offence of rioting be not committed, with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT—
Provocation for rioting.—A person, who maliciously or recklessly gives provocation to
another by doing an illegal act knowing that such provocation will incite the other to
rioting, is punishable under this section. The offence under this section involves some
act of origination of a riot by doing an illegal act infuriating to the feelings of those who
ultimately come to riot. The expression "gives provocation" connotes such idea. This
section is intended to apply to such provocative words or acts as do not amount
directly to instigation or abetment.168. A mere chance provocation is not sufficient to
justify conviction under this section.169. The section is divided into two parts. If rioting
is committed the punishment is more severe.
[s 153.1] Essential Ingredients:
(a) The 'act' imputed against the accused is illegal,
(b) He has done such act malignantly or wantonly, and,
(c) He has given provocation to any person intending or knowing that such
provocation will cause the offence of rioting.170.
1. 'Malignantly'.— implies a sort of general malice.171. The adverbs 'maliciously' and
'malignantly' are synonymous. Malice is not, as in ordinary speech, only an expression
of hatred or ill-will to an individual, but means an unlawful act done intentionally
without just cause or excuse.172. Malignant means extreme malevolence or enmity;
violently hostile or harmful.
2. 'Wantonly'.— means recklessly, thoughtlessly, without regard for right or
consequences. This word gives to the offence contained in this section a far larger,
vaguer and more comprehensive scope, than would be implied by the word
'malignantly' standing alone. It occurs only in this section of the Code, while the word
'malignantly' occurs once again in section 270.
[s 153.2] CASES.—
The affixing of the poster exhorting for boycotting the election, even if it is
objectionable, is not sufficient to show that by such affixture provocation is given to any
person for causing the offence of rioting. Howsoever deplorable be the act of affixing
the poster, to constitute the offence under section 153 of IPC, 1860, over and above the
provocation that is likely to give cause for rioting, it has to be shown that the act —
affixing of the poster —is illegal.173.
Where the accused wrote a pamphlet in praise of a person who was opposed to the
High Priest of the Borah community in certain matters, but his real intention appeared
to be to show a grave insult to the High Priest, an insult which was likely to inflame the
feelings of the followers of the High Priest and to lead to a riot, it was held that he was
guilty under this section.174. Where a bride and bridegroom belonging to depressed
classes rode in palanquins through a village in spite of the protests of high caste
Hindus, it was held that this was not an illegal act for which they could be convicted
under this section.175. Where the accused unfastened the string of the National flag
after flag-hoisting ceremony and tried to trample on it, it was held that the accused was
guilty under this section as the act of the accused was deliberately insulting to the flag
and thereby the accused intended to wound the feelings and sentiments of the other
persons present.176.

sentiments of others. It was held that a true publication of such remarks would not come within
the ambit of section 153, though they might constitute defamation. See also Baragur Ram
