When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.
If the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to commit which, occasions
the exercise of the right of private defence, be theft, mischief, or criminal trespass,
not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, that right
does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to the
restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of
any harm other than death.
COMMENT.â€”
This section applies in cases where an injury (but not death) is inflicted on the offender
in the course of his committing the offences of theft, mischief, or criminal trespass by
the person exercising the right of private defence. But the section does not apply to a
case where death has been caused in exercise of the supposed right of private
defence.499. Even so where the accused had killed a person by exceeding his right of
private defence of property under this section, his case would fall within the ambit of
Exception-II to section 300 IPC, 1860, and his offence would amount to culpable
homicide not amounting to murder. He could not, therefore, be punished with a
sentence of death. In the instant case the sentence was altered to one of life
imprisonment.500.
Sections 101 and 104 restrict the right of private defence in certain cases to voluntarily
causing hurt or grievous hurt. Section 101 is a corollary to section 100, and this section
tosection 103.
