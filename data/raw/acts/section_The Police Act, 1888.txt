The Police Act, 1888
(3 of 1888)
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-Under the provisions of the various Police Acts in force in British India, namely, Acts 24 of 1859 and 5 of 1861 and Bombay Act 7 of 1867, the employment of police officers is restricted to the presidency, province or place of the police establishment of which they are members. These provisions cause much inconvenience. In the case of a railway system passing through territories under the administration of different Local Governments, they necessitate the employment of a different police-force under the control of a different authority for each portion of the line which is within the limits of the territories of a different Local Government. On the North Western Railway, for example, there are at present no less than seven different forces of police under the control of various authorities. Again these provisions prevent even the temporary employment, on an emergency, of police officers of one province in any part of another province. With the object of removing these inconveniences this Bill has been prepared. In order to provide for the employment, under the control of one police authority, of one police force within limits which are not conterminous with the limits of a Local Administration, the Bill empowers the Governor-General in Council to create general police districts embracing parts of two or more provinces and to enrol for service therein a special police force under special police authorities, and it further authorises the temporary employment of police officers in places beyond the presidency or general police district to which they belong.
An Act to amend the law relating to the regulation of Police.
Whereas  it is expedient to relax those provisions of Acts for the regulation of police which restrict the employment of police officers to the presidency, province or place of the police establishment of which they are members;
It is hereby enacted as follows:-
