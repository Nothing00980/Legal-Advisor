Marrying again during lifetime of husband or wife.
Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries 1 in any case in which such
marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife, 2
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Exception3.—This section does not extend to any person whose marriage with such
husband or wife has been declared void by a Court of competent jurisdiction,
nor to any person who contracts a marriage during the life of a former husband or
wife, if such husband or wife, at the time of the subsequent marriage, shall have been
continually absent from such person for the space of seven years, and shall not have
been heard of by such person as being alive within that time provided the person
contracting such subsequent marriage shall, before such marriage takes place,
inform the person with whom such marriage is contracted of the real state of facts so
far as the same are within his or her knowledge.
State Amendment
Andhra Pradesh.—In A.P. the offence is cognizable, non-bailable, triable by the Magistrate
of the first class and non-compoundable vide A.P. Act No. 3 of 1992, Section 2 (w.e.f. 15-
2-1992).
COMMENT.—
This section punishes the offence known to the English law as bigamy.
[s 494.1] Scope.—
The section does not apply to Mohammedan males, who are allowed to marry more
than one wife, but it applies to Mohammedan females, and to Hindus, Christians8. and
Parsis9. of either sex.
[s 494.2] Ingredients.—
Section 494, IPC, 1860, inter alia, requires the following ingredients to be satisfied,
namely,
(i) the accused must have contracted first marriage;
(ii) he must have married again;
(iii) the first marriage must be subsisting; and
(iv) the spouse must be living.10.
1. 'Having a husband or wife living, marries, etc'.—The validity of a marriage in the case
of Mohammedans and Jews will be determined in accordance with their religious
usages: in the case of Native Christians, by Act XV of 1872, in the case of Parsis, by Act
III of 1936; and in the case of Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains, by Act XXV of 1955.
The validity of a marriage solemnised under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 will be
determined by its provisions.11.
There must be at the time of the second marriage a previous valid and subsisting
marriage.12. If the first marriage is not a valid marriage, no offence is committed by
contracting a second marriage.13.
Divorce dissolves a valid marriage, and the parties obtaining such dissolution can re-
marry.14.
A Mohammedan woman marrying within the period of her iddat (the period of four
months which a divorced wife was to observe after divorce before re-marrying) is not
guilty of bigamy.15.
[s 494.3] Second marriage under Special Marriage Act, 1954.—
SI Jafri J, of the Allahabad High Court observed:16.
Notwithstanding the fact that the personal law permits a muslim male to contract four
marriages, if a second marriage is contracted under the Special Marriage Act 1954 vis-a-vis
the fact that he has a legally wedded wife who has been married to him under the
Mohammedan law, s. 494 has to claw at the erring male … Mohammedan law does not take
preference over Special Marriage Act 1954 … There being no saving clause for the applicant
to purge him of the charges u/s. 494 …, the applicant is liable to be punished under [this
section].
2. 'Marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place
during the life of such husband or wife'.—The Supreme Court has observed that prima
facie, the expression "whoever marries" must mean "whoever marries validly" or
"whoever … marries and whose marriage is a valid one". If the marriage is not a valid
one according to the law applicable to the parties no question of its being void by
reason of its taking place during the life of the wife or the husband of the person arises.
If the marriage is not a valid marriage, it is no marriage in the eyes of the law.17. The
Supreme Court in another case had held that in a bigamy case, the second marriage as
a fact, that is to say, the essential ceremonies constituting it, must be proved.18.
Admission of marriage by the accused is not evidence of it for the purposes of proving
marriage in an adultery or bigamy case.19. Thus, where the second Hindu marriage was
not proved by showing saptapadi and homam, the mere production of a marriage
certificate under section 16 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 would not be sufficient to
prove that the second marriage was performed validly by performing all the essential
ceremonies of a valid marriage. The mere fact of subsequent registration of the second
marriage does not prove the validity of second marriage.20. Merely because the second
marriage even if performed by performing all the essential ceremonies turns out to be
void by virtue of section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, it cannot be said that
section 494, IPC, 1860 will not be attracted.21. If the second marriage was not proved
to have been validly performed by observing essential ceremonies and customs in the
community, the conviction under section 494, IPC, 1860 could not be maintained.22.
Perhaps the Courts in India were obliged to take the view they have taken because of
the word "solemnised" occurring in section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the
inhibition contained in the proviso to section 50 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1972 which
forbids taking into consideration even the opinion of a person with special means of
knowledge to show that the two persons were always received and treated as husband
and wife by their friends and relatives so far offences under sections 494, 495, etc., IPC,
1860 are concerned.23.
Thus, if one deliberately keeps a small lacuna, e.g., instead of taking the seven steps
(saptapadi), takes only six steps while celebrating the second marriage, one can easily avoid
the penalty prescribed by these sections even though one virtually ruins the lives of two
girls. If we are to effectively root out polygamy from this country, we must amend s. 494,
IPC, and s. 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, in such a way that anyone who goes through a
form of marriage during the lifetime of his or her spouse will come within the mischief of
the offence of bigamy. At the same time we should also delete from the proviso to s. 50 of
the Indian Evidence Act, the last portion which says 'or in prosecutions u/s. 494, 495, 497 or
498 of the Indian Penal Code'. The National Committee on the Status of Women too made,
more or less, similar recommendations in its report. It is also felt that ss. 493, 494, 495 and
496, IPC, which have an element of cheating in them and affect unsophisticated rural
women more than women in urban areas should be made cognizable so that these poor
women could get justice without being required to engage lawyers at their own cost.24.
The Courts are also changing their viewpoint. In Indu Bhagya Natekar v Bhagya
Pandurang Natekar,25. it was held that it is not correct to say that in every case of
bigamy, unless the second marriage can be proved by bringing in the evidence of the
performance of ceremonies itself, a conviction under section 494 is virtually
impossible. The accused can be convicted even if there is other reliable evidence to
establish the charge.
Where in a particular community 'saptapadi' was not an essential ceremony, the
provisions of section 7-A of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 applied and, therefore, the
performance of other ceremonies prevalent in the community constituted a valid
marriage.26.
Under the provisions of the Indian Christian Marriage Act (XV of 1872), the first
accused, who was a Roman Catholic Indian Christian, married the complainant, who
was a Protestant, in a Protestant Church, the ceremony being performed by a
Protestant Pastor, and subsequently, after obtaining a release deed from her, he
married the second accused in a Roman Catholic Church, the ceremony being
performed by a Roman Catholic priest. It was held that the first accused had
committed the offence of bigamy punishable under this section. The release deed
executed by the complainant did not operate as a dissolution of the marriage between
the first accused and herself. The marriage between the first accused and the
complainant was a legal and valid marriage and, as it was subsisting when the first
accused married the second accused, the marriage of the first accused with the
second accused was void by reason of its taking place during the life of the
complainant.27.
Good faith and mistake of law are no defences to a charge of bigamy.28.
[s 494.4] Conversion from Hinduism.—
A married Hindu person contracted second marriage after embracing Islam. The
Supreme Court said that despite his conversion he was guilty of the offence under
section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 read with section 494, IPC, 1860 since mere
conversion did not automatically dissolve his first marriage.29. The Court followed its
own decision in Sarla Mudgal v UOI,30. which was to the effect that a Hindu husband
who had, after conversion to Islam, contracted a second marriage without dissolving
his first marriage was guilty of the offence under section 494.
[s 494.5] Ex parte divorce.—
The accused husband entered into second marriage after obtaining ex parte divorce
against his first wife. The Court said that he could not possibly be convicted under the
section, even if the ex parte divorce is subsequently set aside. Criminal proceeding
against the husband was quashed, it being only an exercise in futility.31.
[s 494.6] Custom of second marriage in the community.—
A person was not allowed to be prosecuted under the section because of a custom in
the community. The parties belonged to a scheduled tribe. Their marriage was
governed by the customs and usages applicable to the tribe. There was no allegation in
the complaint nor a proof of it that there was a custom of monogamy in the
community.32.
3. Exception.—The Exception lays down three conditions:—
1. Continual absence of one of the parties for the space of seven years;
2. The absent spouse not having been heard of by the other party as being alive within
that time; and
3. The party marrying must inform the person with whom he or she marries of the
above fact.
[s 494.7] Locus standi to file complaint.—
According to section 198 of Cr PC, 1973, no Court shall take cognizance of an offence
punishable under Chapter XX of the IPC (45 of 1860) except upon a complaint made by
some person aggrieved by the offence. Where the person aggrieved by an offence
punishable under sections 494 or 495 of the IPC (45 of 1860) is the wife, complaint
may be made on her behalf by her father, mother, brother, sister, son or daughter or by
her father's or mother's brother or sister, (with the leave of the Court) or by any other
person related to her by blood, marriage or adoption.
[s 494.8] Complaint by Second wife.—
Section 494 is intended to achieve laudable object of monogamy. This object can be
achieved only by expanding the meaning of the phrase "aggrieved person". Having
regard to the scope, purpose, context and object of enacting section 494 IPC, 1860 and
also the prevailing practices in the society sought to be curbed by section 494 IPC,
1860 there is no manner of doubt that the second wife should be an aggrieved person.
Until the declaration contemplated by section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is
made by a competent Court, the woman with whom second marriage is solemnised
continues to be the wife within the meaning of s 494 IPC and would be entitled to
maintain a complaint against her husband.33.
[s 494.9] Police report.—
In the case of Ushaben v Kishorbhai Chunilal Talpada34.,35. taking note of sub-section
(4) of section 155, Cr PC, 1973 the Apex Court held that if a complaint contains the
allegation about commission of offences both under section 498-A of the IPC, 1860 as
well as section 494 of the IPC, 1860 the Court can take cognizance thereof even on a
police report. The bar under section 198 would not be applicable as complaint lodged
before police for offence under section 494 IPC, 1860 also related to other cognizable
offences and if police files a charge-sheet, the Court can take cognizance also of
offence under section 494 along with other cognizable offences by virtue of section
155(4) of the Cr PC, 1973.36.
[s 494.10] Jurisdiction.—
According to section 182(2) of the Cr PC, 1973 any offence punishable under sections
494 or 495 of the IPC (45 of 1860), may be inquired into or tried by a Court within
whose local jurisdiction the offence was committed or the offender last resided with
his or her spouse by the first marriage or the wife by the first marriage has taken up
permanent residence after the commission of the offence.37.
[s 494.11] Divorce in foreign country.—
The marriage of the accused with the complainant was dissolved by a decree of
divorce granted by a District Court in Sweden. The marriage of the accused with
another lady after expiry of the period of appeal was held to be not an offence under
the section.38.

performed according to the Arya Samaj Custom and it was pleaded that accordingly only three
and a half-rounds of sacred fire were enough to complete the marriage, it was held that without

there was no proof of performance of necessary ceremonies in the second marriage, it was held
that conviction for bigamy was not permissible and the accused could not be punished for
attempt to commit bigamy, Subir Kumar Kundu v State of WB, 1992 Cr LJ 1502 (Cal). D
Vijyalakhsmi v D Sanjeeva Reddy, 2001 Cr LJ 1583 , the first and second marriages should be
proved to have been performed according to the legal or customary requirements applicable to
the caste or community. The Andhra Pradesh State Amendment which has been approved by
the President and which makes the offence cognizable would prevail over the Central
Legislation in case of conflict. P Satyanarayana v P Mallaiah, 1997 Cr LJ 211 : (1996) 6 SCC 122 ,
the husband admitted second marriage after 10 years of desertion by his wife. The court said
that the prosecution was not absolved of its burden of proving that the second wife was taken
after solemnising due ceremonies of Hindu marriage. Manju Ram Kalita v State of Assam, (2009)

Cr LJ 3382 (Pat), mere exchange of garlands could not take the place of a ceremony unless
there was a custom to that effect. Manjula v Mani, 1998 Cr LJ 3244 (Ori), first marriage
subsisting, second marriage proved by witnesses and entries in the marriage register under the
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Those who came to bless the second marriage were not held to be
guilty of abetment. The court also said that solemnisation of second marriage in accordance
with applicable ceremonies is not necessary for conviction, viz., section 7A of the Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955. Yelamanchali Nageswari v Venkata Prasada Rao, 1998 Cr LJ 4128 (AP),
admission of second marriage by the accused in the application for mutual divorce was not
considered to be sufficient unless there was evidence of ceremonies or some other legally
sanctioned form. See also, Bhagwan Swaroop Srivastava v Asha Srivastava, 1998 Cr LJ 265 (Raj);
