COMMENT—
Before holding a person to be guilty of offence under section 460, IPC, 1860, the
prosecution must prove:—
(i) that the accused committed lurking house trespass by night; or house breaking by
night;
(ii) that he caused, or attempted to cause, death or grievous hurt;
(iii) that he did above whilst engaged in committing lurking house trespass by night or
house breaking by night. On the aforesaid analysis of section, it is clear that this
section applies to those persons who have actually committed lurking house trespass
at night and not to those who may have accompanied their associates but did not
commit the offence. Indeed, it applies to actual doers, and not the others.730. This
section deals with the constructive liability of persons jointly concerned in committing
'lurking house-trespass' or 'house-breaking by night' in the course of which death or
grievous hurt to any one is caused. It is immaterial who causes death or grievous hurt.
Every person jointly concerned in committing such house-trespass or house-breaking
shall be punished in the manner provided in the section. A person who actually
commits murder in the course of committing house-breaking will attract the penalty
under section 302.731. Every person who is jointly concerned in committing the offence
of lurking house trespass by night or house breaking by night is to be punished with life
imprisonment where death has been caused or with imprisonment which may extend
to ten years where grievous hurt has been caused to any person. This joint liability is
based upon the principle of constructive liability. Thus, the person who has actually
committed the death or grievous hurt would be liable to be punished under the relevant
provisions, i.e., section 302 or section 326, as the case may be, while committing the
offence of lurking house trespass by night. It is possible that common intention or
object be not the foundation of an offence under section 460 IPC, 1860. Thus, to
establish an offence under section 460, it may not be necessary for the prosecution to
establish common intention or object. Suffice it will be to establish that they acted
jointly and committed the offences stated in section 460 IPC, 1860. The principle of
constructive liability is applicable in distinction to contributory liability. The Supreme
Court in the case of Abdul Aziz v State of Rajasthan,732. clearly stated that if a person
committing housebreaking by night also actually commits murder, he must attract the
penalty for the latter offence under section 302 and the Court found it almost
impossible to hold that he can escape the punishment provided for murder merely
because the murder was committed by him while he was committing the offence of
housebreaking and that he can only be dealt with under section 460.733.
The words "at the time of the committing of" are limited to the time during which the
criminal trespass continues which forms an element in house-trespass, which is itself
essential to house-breaking, and cannot be extended so as to include any prior or
subsequent time.734. If the offender causes grievous hurt while running away, he will
not be punishable under this section.735.
[s 460.1] Section 449 and section 460.—
The element of house-trespass is common in both the sections and section 460 has
large ambit. In section 449 actual commission of offence punishable with death is not
required and if the house trespass is proved in order to commit such offence, the
accused persons would be liable for punishment under section 449, whereas in section
460 if a person guilty of lurking house trespass or housebreaking in night voluntarily
cause or attempt to cause death or grievous hurt to any person then every person
jointly concerned in committing such lurking house trespass in night shall be liable for
punishment.736.

731. Sohan Singh v State, AIR 1964 Punj 156 . Where in a case of house-breaking committed in
well-lighted house, the victim identified the accused and the articles stolen from her house in
two exercises of identification parades, conviction of the accused was sustained. Kasu Bhai v
State of HP, 1992 Cr LJ 3251 (HP). State of MP v Bhagwan Singh, 2002 Cr LJ 3169 (MP), the
accused assailants entered into a house during night time, assaulted a man and hanged him
and also caused death of his daughter. The motive was to avenge the action against them to
prevent them from opening drainage towards the disputed land. They were held guilty of lurking
trespass and murder. Abdul Aziz v State of Rajasthan, (2007) 10 SCC 283 [LNIND 2007 SC 592] ,
house-breaking by several persons, death caused by one of them, others also constructively
liable, attracted section 302. It would require the accused to be charged with murder also. Mati

State of Madhya Pradesh, 2011 CR LJ 1548 (Chh)- the appellants have been held responsible for
causing death of the 2 deceased persons with the aid of section 149, IPC, 1860. It is not a case
in which at the time of committing lurking house trespass by night any one of the appellant
caused death of the deceased person and liability has to be fastened on the principle of section
460. In the facts and circumstances of the case, if all the appellants were held liable for
punishment under section 302 with the aid of section 149, IPC, 1860 on the principles of
common object of the unlawful assembly, of which they were the members, it was not
necessary to punish them separately under section 460, IPC, 1860 and punishment of the
appellants under section 460, IPC, 1860, in the facts and circumstances of the case, also
requires to be set aside.
734. Muhammad, (1921) 2 Lah 342. State of Madhya Pradesh v Kalli, 2012 Cr LJ 2399 (MP)-
where death was caused while committing theft in the house of deceased, and looted property
from house of deceased were recovered from possession of accused and identified by
witnesses in test identification parade, conviction of accused is held proper.

460 and 382, the accused was sentenced to undergo 3 years RI. The proceeding had lasted for

strain, the court reduced their sentence to the period already undergone with a fine of Rs. 1000.
