[Vide A.P.G.O. Ms. No. 732, dated 5th December, 1991].
COMMENT—
This section provides for voluntarily obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his
duties. It must be shown that the obstruction or resistance was offered to a public
servant in the discharge of his duties or public functions as authorised by law. The
mere fact of a public servant believing that he was acting in the discharge of his duties
will not be sufficient to make resistance or obstruction to him amount to an
offence.100. If the public servant is acting in good faith under colour of his office there
is no right of private defence against his act.101.
The word "obstruction" connotes some overt act in the nature of violence or show of
violence.102. To constitute "obstruction", it is not necessary that there should be actual
criminal force. It is sufficient if there is either a show of force or a threat or any act
preventing the execution of any act by a public servant.103. Though an offence under
this section is a non-cognizable one, by virtue of powers vested in the State
Government under section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932, it can be
made a cognizable offence in a specified area by means of a notification, while such
notification remains in force.
[s 186.1] Initiation of Prosecution.—
To initiate prosecution under this section it is necessary to see that the complaint is
filed under section 195(1)(a), Cr PC, 1973, by the concerned public servant or his
superior officer to whom he is administratively subordinate (See also discussion under
sub-head "Condition precedent for Prosecution under section 182 ante.) It is also not
possible to bypass the requirements of section 195(1)(a), Cr PC, 1973, by merely
changing the label of the offence, say from section 186 to section 353, IPC, 1860.104.
[s 186.2] Offences with bar under section 195 Cr PC, 1973 with some offences
without the bar.—
Where an accused commits some offences which are separate and distinct from those
contained in section 195 of the Cr PC, 1973, section 195 will affect only the offences
mentioned therein unless such offences form an integral part so as to amount to
offences committed as a part of the same transaction, in which case the other
offences also would fall within the ambit of section 195 of the Code.105. It is a well-
accepted proposition of law that when an accused commits some offences which are
separate and distinct from those contained in section 195; section 195 will affect only
the offences mentioned therein unless such other offences form an integral part of the
same so as to amount to offences committed as a part of the same transaction. That
in such case the other offences would also fall within the ambit of section195 of the
Code. In other words, the offences charged against the petitioners under section143,
147, 148, 149, 332, 333 and 307 of IPC, 1860, cannot be split from the complaint for a
separate offence in the facts and circumstances of the present case, and thereby
cognizance in respect to said offences are also barred under section 195(1)(a)(i) of the
Code.106.
[s 186.3] CASES.—Obstruction.—
A Circle Inspector went into the compound of the accused with a village servant to
remove a portion of the hedge which was an encroachment. When the servant put his
scythe to the hedge to cut it, the accused caught hold of the scythe and threatened
him. It was held that the accused was guilty of an offence under this section, since his
laying hold of the scythe amounted to physical obstruction, and the obstruction offered
to the servant was tantamount to obstruction to the Circle Inspector under whose
orders he was acting.107. The daughter of the tenant of the accused died of
electrocution. The police-officers entered the premises with permission to check fresh
wiring and leakage of current. They were prevented from taking photographs by the
accused and also not allowed to leave the house. The Court said that this amounted to
obstruction within the meaning of section 186 and wrongful confinement within the
meaning of section 342.108. Section 186 contemplates obstruction of a public servant
in the discharge of his public duty and section 332 contemplates voluntarily causing
hurt to him to deter him from performing his public duty. The gravity of the offences is
different. Offence under section 332 is cognizable. The requirement of making a
complaint in writing as postulated by section 195, Cr PC, 1973, cannot be extended to
the case of an offence under section 332.109.
[s 186.4] Section 186 and Section 353: Distinction between.—
Sections 186 and 353, IPC, 1860 relate to two distinct offences and while the offence
under the latter section is a cognizable offence the one under the former section is not
so. The ingredients of the two offences are also distinct. Section 186, IPC, 1860 is
applicable to a case where the accused voluntarily obstructs a public servant in the
discharge of his public functions but under section 353, IPC, 1860 the ingredient of
assault or use of criminal force while the public servant is doing his duty as such is
necessary. The quality of the two offences is also different. Section 186 occurs in
Chapter X of the IPC, 1860 dealing with Contempts of the lawful authority of public
servants, while section 353 occurs in Chapter XVI regarding the Offences affecting the
human body. It is well established that section 195 of the Cr PC, 1973 does not bar the
trial of an accused person for a distinct offence disclosed by the same set of facts but
which is not within the ambit of that section.110. If in truth and substance the offence in
question falls in the category of sections mentioned in section 195 of the Code and it
was not open to bypass its provisions even by choosing to prosecute under section
353, IPC, 1860 only.111.
