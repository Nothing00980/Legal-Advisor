Issuing or signing false certificate.
Whoever issues or signs any certificate required by law to be given or signed, or
relating to any fact of which such certificate is by law admissible in evidence, knowing
or believing that such certificate is false in any material point, shall be punished in the
same manner as if he gave false evidence.
COMMENT.—
Several laws require a certificate of some matter to be given. The offence of certifying
in any of these, knowing or believing that the certificate is false, is put on the same
footing as the offence of giving false evidence. The certificate must, however, be false
in a material point. The issuing or signing must be by the officer or person authorized to
certify.
[s 197.1] Ingredients.—
The section has two essentials:—
1. Issuing or signing of a certificate—
(a) required by law to be given or signed, or
(b) relating to a fact of which such certificate is by law admissible in
evidence.
2. Such certificate must have been issued or signed knowing or believing that it is
false in any material point.
Before convicting a person for offence under section 197, IPC, 1860 the prosecution
must prove the following facts:-—
(i) that the document in question purports to be a certificate;
(ii) that such certificate is required by law to be given or signed, or that it related to
some fact of which such certificate is by law admissible in evidence;
(iii) that such certificate is false;
(iv) that it is false in a material point;
(v) that the accused issued or signed the same;
(vi) that he, when doing so, knew or believed, such certificate to be false.121.
[s 197.2] Certificate.—
As per section 197, certificate contemplated therein is a certificate, which is required
not to be given or signed for the use in the Court's administration of Justice. That
means, certificate is issued as required by some law and it has some reference to
some statutory requirements. Information given by petitioner to Process Server is that
he has not heard about the Noticee for the last two years and his whereabouts are not
known. That is not a certificate contemplated under any statute. Therefore, section 197
also will have no application.122. The expression "by law admissible in evidence"
means that the certificate should by some provision of law be admissible in evidence
as such a certificate without further proof.123. A medical certificate is not such a
certificate and the issue or use of a false medical certificate does not render a person
liable under this section or section 198.124.

to get a pre-matric scholarship has been held to be not a certificate within the meaning of this
section. Haladhara Karji v Dileswar Subudhi, 1989 Cr LJ 629 (Ori), no caste was mentioned in the
certificate. Premlata v State of Rajasthan, 1998 Cr LJ 1430 (Raj), a statement would become a
false certificate if the law requires the issue of such a certificate as a legal proof. In this case
the certificate was issued by the headmaster, though he was not authorised to do so. The
candidate used the certificate for obtaining an appointment. A prima facie case under section
198 was made out against the headmaster.
