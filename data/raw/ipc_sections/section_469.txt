COMMENT—
This section is similar to sections 452 and 455. To prove the charge for the offence
under section 458, IPC, 1860, the prosecution must prove:—
(i) that the accused committed lurking house-trespass by night, or house-breaking
by night;
(ii) that he did as above after having made preparation for causing hurt, or for
assaulting, or for wrongfully restraining some person, or for putting some one in
fear of hurt, assault or wrongful restraint.723.
It only applies to the house-breaker who actually has himself made preparation for
causing hurt to any person, etc., and not to his companions as well who themselves
have not made such preparation.724. There should also be some evidence of lurking
house-trespass, as defined in section 443, IPC, 1860.
[s 458.1] Section 458 is not a cognate offence of section 398.—
The accused was charged under section 398 of IPC, 1860 and section 25(1)(A) and
section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959. Trial Court acquitted the accused from both the
charges holding that prosecution has failed to prove the charges however, come to the
conclusion that the accused committed an offence under section 458 of IPC, 1860. The
High Court held that section 458 of Penal Code in no way was a cognate offence of
offence under section 398, IPC, 1860. Hence, conviction for offence under section 458
IPC, 1860 without framing charge is liable to be set aside.725.
