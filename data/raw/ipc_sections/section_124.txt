Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment— if offence be not
committed.
Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not
committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this
Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of any
description provided for that offence for a term which may extend to one-fourth part
of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided for that
offence, or with both;
If abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent
offence.
and if the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to
prevent the commission of such offence, the abettor shall be punished with
imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for a term which may
extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine
as is provided for the offence, or with both.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some
favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B refuses to accept the bribe.
A is punishable under this section.
(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence,
A has nevertheless committed the offence defined in this section, and is
punishable accordingly.
(c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission
of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not committed, A is liable to one-
half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also
to fine.
(d) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police-officer, whose duty it is
to prevent that offence. Here, though the robbery be not committed, B is
liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the
offence of robbery, and also to fine.
COMMENT—
Where abetted offence not committed.—This section provides for the abetment of an
offence punishable with imprisonment. There is no corresponding provision in the
Code relating to abetment of an offence punishable with fine only.
Three different states of fact may arise after an abetment—
(1) No offence may be committed. In this case the offender is punishable under
sections 115 and 116 for the mere abetment to commit a crime.
(2) The very act at which the abetment aims may be committed, and will be punishable
under sections 109 and 110.
(3) Some act different but naturally flowing from the act abetted may be perpetrated, in
which case the abettor will fall under the penalties of sections 111, 112 and 113.
[s 116.1] Section 116 and Section 306.—
Section 116, IPC, 1860 is "abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment if
offence be not committed". But the crux of the offence under section 306 itself is
abetment. In other words, if there is no abetment there is no question of the offence
under section 306 coming into play. It is inconceivable to have abetment of an
abetment. Hence, there cannot be an offence under section 116 read with section 306,
IPC, 1860.114. The Supreme Court has never laid down in Satvir Singh115. that under no
circumstance an offence under section 306 read with section 511 IPC, 1860 can be
committed. The Supreme Court did not have occasion to consider whether a conviction
for an offence of attempt to abet the commission of suicide is punishable under
section 306 read with section 511, IPC, 1860. Merely because the section opens with
the words "if any person commits suicide" it cannot be held that in a case of
unsuccessful suicide there is no attempt to abet the commission of suicide. Suicide
and its attempt on the one hand and abetment of commission of suicide and its
attempt on the other are treated differently by law and, therefore, the one who abets the
commission of an unsuccessful attempt to commit suicide cannot be held to be
punishable merely under section 309 read with section 116, IPC, 1860. To implement
the scheme of law he has got to be held to be punishable under section 306 read with
section 511, IPC, 1860.116.
