The Registration Act, 1908
(16 of 1908)
Last Updated 23th November, 2020
Statement of Objects and Reasons. - This is a pure consolidating Bill. The provisions relating to the registration of documents are now scattered about in seven enactments. The object of the present Bill is to collect these provisions and to incorporate them in one Act. This will make the law more easily ascertainable. It will further clear the Statute-book of three entire Acts and will enable two more Acts to be entirely removed from it on the coming into force of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and of the Indian Limitation Bill, now before Council.
The fact that the General Clauses Act, 1897, will apply to the-Bill when passed has rendered it unnecessary to retain some provisions of the present Acts. The opportunity has been taken to incorporate alterations of a formal character intended merely to improve and simplify the language of the existing Act. The numbering of the sections of the Act of 1877 has been preserved.
It has been found that the mere process of consolidation might result in the law being changed in some respects. To avoid this some few amendments appear to be necessary.
Amendment Act 17 of 1956-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - While India is a secular State recording of castes and sub-castes of parties mentioned in a deed for registration in States is anomalous. This Bill is intended to remove that anomaly.
Amendment Act 45 of 1969-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - Under section 30(2) of the Indian Registration Act, 1908, the Registrar of a district in which any of the three Presidency-towns of Calcutta, Bombay or Madras is situated may receive and register any document relating to immovable property wherever in India that property may be situated. In view of the growing importance of Delhi as the capital of the Union of India, as a business and commercial centre and as a cosmopolitan town, where people from every part of India come and reside, it has been felt for quite some time that the benefit of section 30(2) may also be extended to Delhi. Representations in this behalf have also been received from the Delhi Administration. The matter has been examined by the Law Commission in its Thirty-first Report. The Commission has recommended that the provisions of section 30(2) of the Indian Registration Act should appropriately be extended to the metropolitan city also. The Bill seeks to implement this recommendation.
2. In consonance with the present legislative practice which has been adopted since the Independence of the country, this opportunity to amend the Indian Registration Act, 1908, is being availed of to suggest the omission of the word "Indian" from the short title of the Act.
Amendment Act 48 of 2001-Statement of Objects and Reasons. - The Registration Act, 1908 was enacted to consolidate the law relating to the registration of documents. The Conference of Chief Ministers and Finance Ministers of States and Union Territories convened by the Union Finance Minister held on the 14th September, 1998 at New Delhi, inter alia, arrived at the following conclusions, namely:-
(i) sub-section (2) of section 30 of the Registration Act, 1908 should be repealed;
(ii) registration of general power of attorney which is in the nature of a contract to sell immovable property be made compulsory and consequential amendments be made in the the Registration Act, 1908, the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and the Indian Stamps Act, 1899;
(iii) to make affixing of the photograph and finger-prints of the executants compulsory at the time of registration of documents;
(iv) to make an enabling provision for computerisation of registration records.
2. Based on the above conclusions arrived at the said Conference, it is proposed
(i) to insert a new sub-section (1-A) in section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 for making registration of the documents containing contracts to transfer for consideration any immovable property compulsory for the purpose of section 53-A of the said Act, section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and Schedule Ito the Stamp Act, 1899;
(ii) to omit sub-section (2) of section 30 and section 67 of the Registration Act, 1908;
(iii) to insert new section 16-A in the Registration Act, 1908 to enable the State Governments to computerise registration records;
(iv) to insert new section 32-A to make affixing of the photographs and finger-prints on the documents compulsory at the time of registration.
