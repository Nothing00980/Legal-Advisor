Public servant disobeying direction of law with intent to save person
from punishment or property from forfeiture.
Whoever, being a public servant, knowingly disobeys any direction of the law as to the
way in which he is to conduct himself as such public servant, intending thereby to
save, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby save, any person from legal
punishment, or subject him to a less punishment than that to which he is liable, or
with intent to save, or knowing that he is likely thereby to save, any property from
forfeiture or any charge to which it is liable by law, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with
fine, or with both.
COMMENT.â€”
This section and the three following sections deal with disobedience on the part of
public servants in respect of official duty.
This section punishes intentional disobedience of any direction of law on the part of a
public servant to save a person from punishment. It is not necessary to show that, in
point of fact, the person so intended to be saved had committed an offence, or was
justly liable to legal punishment. A public servant charged under this section is equally
liable to be punished, although the intention, which he had of saving any person from
legal punishment, was founded upon a mistaken belief as to that person's liability to
punishment.315.
[s 217.1] 'Legal punishment'
does not include departmental punishment.316.
