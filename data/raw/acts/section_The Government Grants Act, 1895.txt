Statement of Objects and Reasons.-The Transfer of Property Act, 1882, sections 10-12 invalidate with certain exceptions all conditions for the forfeiture of the transferred property on alienation by the transferee and all limitations over consequent upon any such alienation or any insolvency of or attempted alienation by him. The Crown is not specifically mentioned in the Act, and it may be assumed that it was not designed to impose fetters of this description upon the discretion of the Crown, especially as to the creation of inalienable jahgirs in grants made for public services; but it has been thought better to set the question at rest by express legislation.
Upon a late occasion the Government of India were advised that it is not competent for the Crown to create an inalienable and impartible estate in the land comprised in any Crown grant, unless such land has heretofore descended by custom as an impartible Raj. The second sub-section of the Bill is intended to obviate this inconvenience by providing that all Crown grants are to be construed according to their tenor, notwithstanding any rule of law which might otherwise affect their operation.
