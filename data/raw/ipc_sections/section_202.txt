False statement made in declaration which is by law receivable as
evidence.
Whoever, in any declaration made or subscribed by him, which declaration any Court
of Justice, or any public servant or other person, is bound or authorised by law to
receive as evidence of any fact, makes any statement which is false, and which he
either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, touching any point
material to the object for which the declaration is made or used, shall be punished in
the same manner as if he gave false evidence.
COMMENT.—
This section makes the penalty attached to the offence of giving false evidence
applicable to declarations which, although not compellable, have, on being made, the
same effect as the compulsory declarations referred to in sections 51 and 191.127.
Voluntary declarations are thus placed on the same level as compulsory declarations.
The Supreme Court has said that the complaint for an offence under section 199, IPC,
1860, must make out the offence by singling out false averment in the complaint. Thus,
where the allegation was that the accused had used a false affidavit before the Rent
Controller but the complaint did not set out a single averment from the said affidavit,
which is said to be false, it was held that the complaint was not maintainable.128.
[s 199.1] Ingredients.—
This section requires three essentials:—
1. Making of a declaration that a Court or a public servant is bound or authorised by
law to receive in evidence.
2. Making of a false statement in such declaration knowing or believing it to be
false.
3. Such false statement must be touching any point material to the object for which
the declaration is made or used.129. Section 199 provides punishment for making
a false statement in a declaration that is by law receivable in evidence. Rival
contentions set out in affidavits accepted or rejected by Courts with reference to
onus probandi do not furnish foundation for a charge under section 199, IPC,
1860.130. A declaration before it could be made the foundation of charge under
section 199 of IPC, 1860, it is necessary that it must be admissible in evidence as
proof of the fact declared under any law in consequence of which the Court is
bound or authorised to receive it as such.131.
