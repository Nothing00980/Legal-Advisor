Dishonestly or fraudulently preventing debt being available for
creditors.
Whoever dishonestly or fraudulently prevents any debt or demand due to himself or to
any other person from being made available according to law for payment of his debts
or the debts of such other person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENTâ€”
This section, like the preceding section, is intended to prevent the defrauding of
creditors by masking property. Any proceedings to prevent the attachment and sale of
debts due to the accused will fall under this section. The offence consists in the
dishonest or fraudulent evasion of one's own liability.
