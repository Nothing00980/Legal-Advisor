"Special law".
A "special law" is a law applicable to a particular subject.
COMMENTâ€”
Laws dealing with special subjects are called special laws. The special laws
contemplated in section 40 and this section are only laws, such as the Excise, Opium,
Cattle Trespass, Gambling and Railway Acts, creating fresh offences, that is, laws
making punishable certain things which are not already punishable under the Penal
Code. Negotiable Instruments Act being a special statute has overriding effect over the
provisions of Cr PC, 1973.303. Since nothing in Factories Act (Special Law) which
prescribes punishment for rash and negligent act of occupier or manager of factory
which resulted into death of any worker or any other person, the general Law, i.e., IPC,
1860 will apply.304.

Section 5 of IPC, 1860.
