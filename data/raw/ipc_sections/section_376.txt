Selling minor for purposes of prostitution, etc.
Whoever sells, lets to hire, or otherwise disposes of1 any 1158.[person under the age
of eighteen years2 with intent that such person shall at any age be employed or used
for the purpose of prostitution or illicit intercourse with any person or for any unlawful
and immoral purpose,3 or knowing it to be likely that such person will at any age be]
employed or used for any such purpose, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall be liable to fine.
1159.[Explanation I.—When a female under the age of eighteen years is sold, let for
hire, or otherwise disposed of to a prostitute or to any person who keeps or manages
a brothel, the person so disposing of such female shall, until the contrary is proved, be
presumed to have disposed of her with the intent that she shall be used for the
purpose of prostitution.
Explanation II.—For the purposes of this section "illicit intercourse" means sexual
intercourse between persons not united by marriage or by any union or tie which,
though not amounting to a marriage, is recognised by the personal law or custom of
the community to which they belong or, where they belong to different communities,
of both such communities, as constituting between them a quasi-marital relation.]
COMMENT.—
This section requires:—
(1) Selling, or letting to hire, or other disposal of a person.
(2) Such person should be under the age of eighteen years.
(3) The selling, letting to hire, or other disposal must be with intent or knowledge of
likelihood that the person shall at any age be employed or used for
(i) prostitution, or
(ii) illicit intercourse with any person, or
(iii) any unlawful and immoral purpose.
[s 372.1] Scope.—
This section applies to males or females under the age of 18 years.1160. It applies to a
married or an unmarried female even where such female, prior to sale or purchase, was
leading an immoral life.1161. It also applies where the girl is a member of the dancing
girl caste.1162.
This section deals with one who sells a person under 18 years; the next section
punishes one who buys such person.
1. 'Sells, lets to hire, or otherwise disposes of'.—These words are the counterpart of
the words "buys, hires or otherwise obtains possession", occurring in section 373. The
performance of gejee (initiation ceremony) on a minor girl does not amount to her
disposal.1163. The ceremony of tying a talimani to a minor girl, worshipping a basin of
water by her and distributing food is merely a preliminary step before the selling, letting
out, or disposing of the girl for the purpose of prostitution, and is no offence under this
section.1164.
2. 'Person under the age of eighteen years'.—The section applies to all persons under
18 years, whether males or females.
3. 'With intent that such persons shall at any age be employed or used for the purpose
of prostitution or illicit intercourse with any person or for any unlawful and immoral
purpose'.—It is necessary to show that the accused intended that the person shall be
employed for an immoral purpose. The introduction of the words 'at any age' takes
away the defence that though a girl was made over to a prostitute it was not intended
that she should actually be used for the purpose of prostitution until she had passed
the age of eighteen years.1165.
The word 'prostitution' is not confined to acts of natural sexual intercourse, but includes
any act of lewdness. It means surrender of a girl's chastity for money.
The words 'illicit intercourse with any person' are explained in Explanation 2. The
accused cannot now rely on the plea that the girl was not destined for a life of
prostitution, but merely for a single act of sexual intercourse. Cases which laid down
that no offence was committed if employment for prostitution was not habitual are no
longer of any authority.
[s 372.2] Adoption of daughter by dancing girl.—
Such adoption would be an offence if it was done with the intention or knowledge
specified in the section. The burden of proof that the possession of the girl is not given
to or obtained by a prostitute for leading an immoral life is on the person who gives the
possession of such girl and the person who receives the girl under Explanation 1 to this
section and section 373.
[s 372.3] Dev dasi.—
The dedication of minors to the service of a temple as dasis (servants) amounts to a
disposal of such minors, knowing it to be likely that they will be used for the purpose of
prostitution within the meaning of this section.1166.
