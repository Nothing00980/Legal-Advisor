Theft by clerk or servant of property in possession of master.
Whoever, being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or
servant, commits theft in respect of any property in the possession of his master or
employer, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENTâ€”
This section provides for a severe punishment when a clerk or servant has committed
theft because he has greater opportunities of committing this offence owing to the
confidence reposed in him. When the possession of the stolen property is with the
master, this section applies; when it is with the servant, section 408 applies. Where
some policemen stole a sum of money shut up in a box, and placed it in the Police
Treasury building, over which they were mounting guard as sentinels, they were held to
have committed an offence under this section and not under section 409.107. Where
the property was not in possession of the master, or the money was entrusted to the
accused and he misappropriated the same, the offence under section 381 will not be
attracted.108.
