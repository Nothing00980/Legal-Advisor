Fraudulent claim to property to prevent its seizure as forfeited or in
execution.
Whoever fraudulently accepts, receives or claims any property or any interest therein,
knowing that he has no right or rightful claim to such property or interest, or practices
any deception touching any right to any property or any interest therein, intending
thereby to prevent that property or interest therein from being taken as a forfeiture or
in satisfaction of a fine, under a sentence which has been pronounced, or which he
knows to be likely to be pronounced by a Court of Justice or other competent
authority, or from being taken in execution of a decree or order which has been made,
or which he knows to be likely to be made by a Court of Justice in a civil suit, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two
years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.â€”
This section deals with the receiver, acceptor, or claimer of property who tries to
prevent its seizure as a forfeiture. It punishes the accomplice just as the preceding
section punishes the principal offender.
