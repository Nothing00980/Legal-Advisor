114.[Whoever sells, or exposes, or has in possession for sale, any goods or things with

case, package or other receptacle in which such goods are contained, shall, unless he
proves—
(a) that, having taken all reasonable precautions against committing an offence
against this section, he had at the time of the commission of the alleged
offence no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark, and
(b) that, on demand made by or on behalf of the prosecutor, he gave all the
information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained
such goods or things, or

be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENT.—
This section punishes those who sell or have in possession for sale goods marked with
a counterfeit property mark. For the purpose of section 486, it is necessary to establish
that the appellant had sold, or exposed for sale, or had in his possession for sale goods
having a mark calculated to cause it to be believed that the scent was the scent
manufactured by and belonging to the complainant.115.
