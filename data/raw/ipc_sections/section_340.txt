COMMENT.—
Section 304A deals with those cases where death is caused by a rash or negligent act;
this section, where hurt is caused. The essential ingredients of section 337, IPC, 1860
are that whoever causes hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as
to endanger human life, or the personal safety of others, shall be punished. So, one of
the essential ingredients of this section must be that hurt must be caused to someone
in doing an act and the person bearing to take reasonable care is said to be negligent
of his act.887. This section applies only to acts done rashly or negligently but without
any criminal intent. But such negligence or rashness must be proved as would
necessarily carry with it criminal liability.888. Where the victim suffered only simple
injuries, section 337 is to be applied.889.
[s 337.1] CASES.—
The allegation was that the accused, car driver, drove car in a rash and negligent
manner and caused injury to a child who was playing on side of road. Evidence showed
that the vehicle was going in middle of road and child was also playing in the middle.
Brake skid marks on road were duly depicted in site plan. Rash or negligent act of
driving by respondent was not proved beyond doubt. Acquittal of accused was held
proper.890. Injured was occupant of the truck along with the petitioner and had received
the injuries on account of the incident/accident where the truck after hitting the Motor
Cycle, had gone and struck against the pole. No allegation of any intention or
knowledge on the part of the petitioner can be made to attract the offence under
section 325, IPC, 1860.
[s 337.2] Section 324 vis-a-vis section 337.—
Essential ingredients to make out an offence under section 324 IPC, 1860 should be
that there must be voluntarily causing hurt and also required intention. But evidence
showed that there was no intention of petitioner/ accused to attack victim and his
intention was only to attack, witness because of some altercation or dispute between
them. Petitioner/accused cannot be said to have committed the offence punishable
under section 324 IPC, 1860. At the same time evidence showed that victim received
simple injuries. Petitioner liable to be convicted under section 337 of IPC, 1860 and not
under section 324.891.
[s 337.3] Negligence with reference to gun.—
The causing of hurt by negligence in the use of a gun was held to fall within the purview
of this section rather than of section 286. But where all the evidence against the
accused was that he went out shooting when people were likely to be in fields and that
a single pellet from his gun struck a man who was sitting in a field, it was held that this
was not sufficient evidence of rashness or negligence to support a conviction under
this section.892.
[s 337.4] Negligent operation.—
The accused removed intra-uterine device during the fourth month of pregnancy of the
complainant. The latter had a premature delivery. The child died after 22 days of
delivery. The Court said that the incident was not the direct result of the act of the
accused. The complaint was quashed.893.
[s 337.5] Conviction under section 279 and section 337.—
Whether a Court can convict a person under sections 279 and 337, IPC, 1860 for
commission of the same act of offence and accordingly pass sentence under both the
sections. As the offence having been outcome of the same act, the Court should
punish the accused for one offence and at the same time, while passing the order of
sentence, the Court should also consider that when the sentence prescribed under
section 279, IPC, 1860 being higher it is a grave offence than the offence prescribed
under section 337, IPC, 1860 the accused could be punished under section 279, IPC,
1860 only.894.
[s 337.6] Factories Act, 1948.—
Section 92 of the Factories Act, 1948 will come into play even if nobody sustains any
injury or even if the accident does not result in death of any person. But sections 337
and 338, IPC, 1860 will apply where a negligent act results in causing injuries to any
person.895.
[s 337.7] Moral turpitude.—
Offence punishable under section 337 IPC, 1860 would not involve moral turpitude so
as to remove the petitioner—accused from service.896.
[s 337.8] Sentence.—
Where the accused was convicted under section 337 for an incident of accident
occurring 20 years before and he had already served a part of sentence and had
children of tender age, his sentence was reduced to the period already undergone.897.
[s 337.9] Pleading guilty.—
Pleading guilty is not a ground for the Magistrate to let off the accused with sentence
of fine only.898.
