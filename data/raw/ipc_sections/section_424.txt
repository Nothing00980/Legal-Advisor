COMMENTâ€”
The reason for inserting section 413 by the legislature is clear from the language of the
section. The legislature purposely enacted knowing it well that there is already section
411 in respect of offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property knowing it to be
stolen. The legislature inserted section 413 in the IPC, 1860 where under it is provided
that if a person is habitually dealing in stolen property, he will be charged for offence
under section 413, IPC, 1860. The terms of the provision make it clear that "habitually
dealing" means there is evidence on record that there are other instances other than
the present instance of the accused found to be indulging in the act and he is facing
trial, then, it can be said that section 413, IPC, 1860 is attracted.467. This section
punishes severely the common receiver or professional dealer in stolen property.

1956).
