Dishonestly breaking open receptacle containing property.
Whoever dishonestly or with intent to commit mischief, breaks open or unfastens any
closed receptacle which contains or which he believes to contain property, shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two
years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENTâ€”
This and the following section provide for the same offence. As soon as the receptacle
is broken open or unfastened the offence is complete. Where an IT raid could not be
completed on the same day and the raiding team put the seized jewellery in an almirah
and after locking and sealing it, left it in the custody of the accused, the latter was held
liable of this offence because he cut the almirah to take out some articles.737.
