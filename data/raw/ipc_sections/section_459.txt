COMMENT—
In order to sustain conviction under the section it has to be found that the intention of
the accused to commit an offence or intimidate, insult or annoy the complainant. There
must be an unlawful entry and there must be proof of one or the other of the intentions
mentioned in section 441. In this case, the evidence produced clearly established the
offence.690. The complainant was allotted a shop by the Rehabilitation Department
because of his being a displaced person, but the accused persons did not allow him to
enter the shop. Though the accused persons entered the shop lawfully they retained it
unlawfully and dishonestly for more than 37 years. They were held to be guilty under
this section read with section 34. The complainant died during the revision petition.
The accused persons' conviction was maintained but they were released on probation
and directed to restore the shop to the complainant's son.691. Allegation was that
accused went to house of victim in order to commit offence of rape. Though rape was
not committed at house of victim but committed at house of accused but entry of
accused into house of victim was with intent to commit offence of rape. Accused is
liable to be convicted under section 448 IPC, 1860.692.

respondent always had actual physical possession. He alleged that the respondent demolished
the chamber and committed theft of his books and equipment. The court found that there was
written notice to the petitioner of demolition and also that the charge of theft was vague
because no details of books and equipment alleged to be stolen were given. See also Ram
