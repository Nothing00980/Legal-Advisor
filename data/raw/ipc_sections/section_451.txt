COMMENTâ€”
In order to attract the provisions of section 440 read with section 44, Penal Code, it is
necessary to allege and establish the following three essentials which constitute the
offence under the said sections:-
(1) Intention or knowledge of likelihood to cause wrongful loss or damage to the
public or to any person.
(2) Causing the destruction of some property or any such change in any property or
in the situation thereof; and
(3) Such changes must result in destroying or diminishing the value or utility of any
property or affecting it injuriously.
It is thus, plain that either destruction of property or some change in the property or in
the situation which has the effect of destroying or diminishing the value or utility or, in
any event, affecting it injuriously is necessary. The word 'property' used in this section
really means some intangible property capable of being destroyed or damaged in its
value or utility. It must be remembered that section 440 read with section 44, IPC, 1860
is an offence committed against the property. Sections 425 and 440 appear in the 17th
chapter entitled "Offences against Property." If there is no allegation that mischief was
committed through the medium of property as is visualised by section 440 read with
section 425, IPC, 1860, it is plain that it cannot be validly said that an offence is
constituted.648.
