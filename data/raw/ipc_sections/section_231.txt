proceeding.
Whoever intentionally offers any insult, or causes any interruption to any public

with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.
STATE AMENDMENT
Andhra Pradesh.— Offence under section 228 is cognizable. [Vide A.P.G.O. Ms. No. 732,
dated 5th December, 1991].
COMMENT.—
The object of this section is to punish a person who intentionally insults in any way the
Court administering justice. It lays down the highest sentence that can be inflicted for
contempt of Court. By a notification under section 10(1) of The Criminal Law
Amendment Act, 1932 the State Government can make an offence under section 228,
IPC, 1860, a cognizable offence for a specified area for such time as the notification
remains in force. No Court shall take cognizance of the offence under section 228,
when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any
proceeding in any Court, except on the complaint in writing of that Court by such officer
of the Court as that Court may authorise in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court
to which that Court is sub-ordinate.389.
[s 228.1] Ingredients.—
The essential ingredients of the offence under this section are— (1) intention, (2) insult
or interruption to a public servant and (3) the public servant insulted or interrupted
must be sitting in any stage of a judicial proceeding.390. The fact that the Court feels
insulted is no reason for holding that any insult is intended.391.
The whole sitting of a Court for the disposal of judicial work from the opening to the
rising of the Court is a judicial proceeding, and the necessary interval between the
conclusion of one case and the opening of another is a stage in a judicial
proceeding.392.
Acts, such as rude and contumelious behaviour, obstinacy, perverseness, prevarication,
or refusal to answer any lawful question, breach of the peace or any wilful disturbance
whatever, will amount to contempt of Court.
If the offence of contempt of Court is summarily dealt with under section 345 of the
Criminal Procedure Code, the maximum punishment that can be imposed is fine not
exceeding Rs. 200.
The offence under the section is not punishable as contempt of Court. The definition of
"criminal contempt" in section 2(c) of The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 includes acts
which constitute an offence under section 228, IPC, 1860 and also goes beyond such
acts, being wider than section 228.393.
[s 228.2] CASES.—Contempt.—
A person persisting in putting irrelevant and vexatious questions to a witness after
warning;394. a person making an impertinent threat to a witness in the box,395. a
person sentenced to two hours' imprisonment and ordered to be kept in custody
insulting the Judge in the grossest manner;396. a person calling the trial Judge as "a
prejudiced judge;"397. a person stating in an application for transfer of a case that the
Court had become hostile to him;398. and a person insisting upon staying in the Court
room after the presiding officer of the Court had asked him to leave the Court and after
he had been warned that action for contempt of Court would be taken against him,399.
were all held guilty of contempt of Court under this section. A Commissioner appointed
by the Court being a public servant a person who intentionally insults or interrupts him
while he is sitting in a judicial proceeding commits an offence under section 228, IPC,
1860, and should be punished under that section and not under section 345, Cr PC,
1973.400. Hurling of shoes by an Advocate at the presiding officer of the Court was
contempt. Where the party to a case shouted inside a Court room in offensive language
as the presiding officer told that after filing of the rejoinder by the opposite party
arguments were closed, summary contempt proceedings under section 480 (now
section 345) Cr PC, 1973, read with section 228, IPC, 1860, were fully justified though in
view of the written apology tendered then and there the party should not be convicted
under section 228, IPC, 1860.401.
[s 228.3] Refusal to answer question.—
Prevarication by a witness and refusal to answer a question amount to intentional
interruption within the meaning of the section.402.
[s 228.4] No contempt.—
A person leaving the Court when ordered to remain;403. or making signs from outside
to a prisoner on his trial;404. a person listening to evidence after being told to leave the
Court;405. a person using vulgar language for the purpose of emphasis;406. a person
walking out of the Court without answering the question whether he had any
witness;407. a person giving away in marriage a minor girl while she was in the custody
of a guardian appointed by the Court;408. a person appearing as an assessor in Court
dressed in a shirt and a cap;409. a person writing a letter to a Judge imputing an
unlawful act causing loss to him,410. and a pleader saying that he 'resented' the remark
of the Court and that another remark was 'improper', and that a certain action of the
Court was 'strange',411. were held to have committed no offence under this section.
[s 228.5] Allocation of sitting accommodation in Court room.—
A litigant, conducting his case without the aid of counsel, was occupying the seat in the
Court room meant for the advocates while senior advocates were standing. He refused
to vacate the seat when asked to do so by the presiding officer. His conviction under
section 228 was upheld.412.
[s 228.6] Free legal assistance.—
It was held in Shrichand v State of MP that the right to free legal assistance has to be
confined to the offences that are punishable with substantive sentence of
imprisonment. The right to free legal assistance at the State cost could not be
extended to an offence under section 228, IPC, 1860 of which the accused was being
tried summarily because on conviction he could not have been visited with any
substantive imprisonment.413.
[s 228.7] Insult to Court.—
Several accused persons faced a trial and were found guilty of various offences. One of
them, on hearing the judgment, addressed to the Court and uttered filthy abuses and
made contemptuous statements. The Court said that it amounted to an insult of the
Court. The Court had jurisdiction under the section to punish the accused.414. Where
an accused wrote a letter to the Magistrate asking him for the reasons as to why he
had returned the petition filed by him and also requested him, to give a copy of the
document connected with the case, Magistrate found him to be guilty of offence under
section 228, IPC, 1860. But the Madras High Court set aside the judgment by holding
that it may not be said that the letter has been received by the judicial officer when he
was in any stage of the proceedings in Court and, therefore, the offence under section
228, IPC, 1860 is not be made out.415.
