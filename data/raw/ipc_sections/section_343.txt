Wrongful confinement.
Whoever wrongfully restrains any person in such a manner as to prevent that person
from proceedings1 beyond certain circumscribing limits,2 is said "wrongfully to
confine" that person.
ILLUSTRATIONS
(a) A causes Z to go within a walled space, and locks Z in. A is thus prevented from
proceeding in any direction beyond the circumscribing line of wall. A wrongfully
confines Z.
(b) A places men with firearms at the outlets of a building, and tells Z that they will
fire at Z if Z attempts to leave the building. A wrongfully confines Z.
COMMENT.—
Wrongful confinement, which is a form of wrongful restraint, is keeping a man within
limits out of which he wishes to go, and has a right to go.928.
[s 340.1] Ingredients.—
The section requires—
(1) Wrongful restraint of a person.
(2) Such restraint must prevent that person from proceeding beyond certain
circumscribing limits. The offence of wrongful confinement as defined under
section 340 of the Code occurs when individual is wrongfully restrained in such
a manner as to prevent him/her from proceeding beyond certain circumscribing
limits.929.
[s 340.2] Wrongful confinement and wrongful restraint.—
From the definition, it is evident that 'wrongful confinement' is a species of 'wrongful
restraint' as defined in section 339 IPC, 1860. While, in 'wrongful restraint', there is only
a partial suspension of one's liberty, 'wrongful confinement' reflects total suspension of
liberty beyond certain prescribed limits. The period of suspension is immaterial for
constituting an offence of 'wrongful confinement' or 'wrongful restraint'. When a person
is restrained and is prevented from going, where he has a right to go, the restraint
becomes wrongful if such restraint is not in exercise of any right, power or authority
under any law.930.
1. 'Prevent that person from proceedings'.—The restraining of a person in a particular
place or compelling him to go in a particular direction by force of an exterior will
overpowering or suppressing in any way his own voluntary action is an imprisonment
on the part of him who exercises that exterior will.931. There can be no wrongful
confinement when a desire to proceed has never existed, nor can a confinement be
wrongful if it was consented to by the person affected.932. Mere insistence by words of
mouth or mere sitting around a person would not satisfy the requirements of the
offence of wrongful confinement which requires that there must be voluntary
obstruction to that person so as to prevent that person from proceeding in any
direction in which that person has a right to proceed.933. To support a charge of
wrongful confinement proof of actual physical restriction is not essential. It is sufficient
if such evidence shows that such an impression was produced on the mind of the
victim as to create a reasonable apprehension in his or her mind that he or she was not
free to depart and that he or she would be forthwith seized or restrained if he or she
attempted to do so.934.
2. 'Certain circumscribing limits'.—
A prison may have its boundary, large or narrow, visible and tangible, or, though real still in
the conception only; it may itself be moveable or fixed: but a boundary it must have; and that
boundary the party imprisoned must be prevented from passing; he must be prevented from
leaving that place, within the ambit of which the party imprisoning would confine him,
except by prison-breach. Some confusion seems to me to arise from confounding
imprisonment of the body with mere loss of freedom: it is one part of the definition of
freedom to be able to go withersoever one pleases; but imprisonment is something more
than the mere loss of this power; it includes the notion of restraint within some limits
defined by a will or power exterior to our own.935.
[s 340.3] Forced to walk.—
Where a person was forced to walk under duress to a particular direction, it amounted
to an offence of wrongful confinement. An act by which a person is prevented from
proceeding towards a particular direction is an offence under the section.936.
[s 340.4] Moral force.—
Detention through the exercise of moral force, without the accompaniment of physical
force or actual conflict, is sufficient to constitute this offence.937.
[s 340.5] Period of confinement.—
The time during which a person is kept in wrongful confinement is immaterial, except
with reference to the extent of punishment.938.
[s 340.6] Remedy of compensation under writ of habeas corpus.—
Freedom from detention and compensation for wrongful detention, it has been held,
can be ordered under writ of habeas corpus; however, the Court added that the remedy
under section 340 IPC, 1860 cannot be treated as an alternative or substitute for
remedy of habeas corpus. It is only an additional remedy.939.
[s 340.7] Compensation for unauthorised detention.—
The petitioner was detained by an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class
whereas the authority for order of detention vested with the State or Central
Government. It was held that the said detention, being without authority of law,
amounted to wrongful confinement. The detention was quashed and the detenu was
granted a compensation of Rs. 3,000.940.
[s 340.8] CASES.—Wrongful confinement.—
Where two police-officers arrested without warrant a person who was drunk and
creating disturbance in a public street, and confined him in the police-station though
one of them knew his name and address and it was not found to what extent he was a
danger to others or their property, it was held that the arrest having been made by the
police-officers without warrant, for a non-cognizable offence, their action amounted to
wrongful confinement unless it was justified on the ground of right of private defence
or under section 81 as was, in fact, held by the Court.941. Though an illegal search in
violation of the provisions of section 165 Cr PC, 1973 can be resisted, there is no
justification for bodily lifting and bringing back the Investigating Officer after he has left
the house and to confine and threaten him till he gives a written statement that he has
searched the house of the appellant. It was held that by such acts the accused had
committed offences of wrongful confinement and assaulting a public servant within
the meaning of sections 342 and 353, IPC, 1860.942. A police officer arrested and
detained a person in the thana lock-up despite production of a bail order from the
Court. It was held that the officer was clearly guilty of an offence under section 342
IPC, 1860.943.
[s 340.9] Custody of child.—
It is an incorrect proposition of law that a father would never be held liable for offence
of wrongful 'confinement' if he detains the child by having snatched her away from the
mother, who, under some authority of law, had, at the time of snatching, the custody of
the child and is entitled to have custody of the child. When a minor is kept against the
will of the person, who has the custody of such a child and/or who is entitled to take
the custody of the child, such detention would amount to 'wrongful confinement'. In
such a case, it is the will of the person, who is entitled to have custody of such a child,
which will be the will of the child, for, the child's willingness or 'consent' would be
immaterial unless the welfare of the child, in a given case, demands removal of the
child from the custody of the person, who is, otherwise, entitled to keep the custody of
the child. Guardian and custodian are not synonymous with each other. Thus, even
when a parent, who, with impunity, snatches away a child from the lawful custody of
the other parent, who held such custody and who is entitled to have the custody of the
child under the law—personal, statutory or otherwise—such snatching away of the child
and his detention against the will of the parent in whose custody the child was, would
amount to an offence of 'wrongful confinement'.944.
[s 340.10] No wrongful confinement.—
Where the wife who has attained the age of 21 stated before the Court that she was not
detained by her parents against her will, there was no wrongful confinement and as
such the habeas corpus petition by the husband could not succeed.945.
