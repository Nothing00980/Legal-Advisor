State Amendment
Andhra Pradesh.— The offence is cognizable, non-bailable, triable by the Magistrate of
the first class and non-compoundable vide A.P. Act No. 3 of 1992, Section 2 (w.e.f. 15-2-
1992), in A.P.
COMMENT.—
The offence mentioned in section 495 IPC, 1860 is extension of section 494 IPC, 1860
and also is an aggravated form of bigamy provided in section 494 IPC, 1860. The
complainant (second wife) has adduced enough evidence to prove that the accused
had concealed the fact of the former marriage by assuring her that he had taken
divorce from his first wife and subsequently married her by performing the essential
Hindu rites and ceremonies in accordance with section 7 of the Hindu Marriage Act,
1955. It is undisputed that accused first got married to Smt. Vijay Saini and thereafter
to the complainant, as admission to this effect has been made by the accused himself
in his statement under section 313 Cr PC, 1973. Accused was rightly convicted under
section 495 IPC, 1860.39.
[s 495.1] Right to file complaint.—
Non-filing of the complaint under sections 494 or 495 IPC, 1860 by the first wife does
not mean that the offence is wiped out. Even otherwise, the second wife suffers several
legal wrongs and legal injuries and hence, complainant (second wife) was having every
right to file the complaint under section 495 IPC, 1860.40.
A bare perusal of the provisions of sections 493 and 495 of IPC, 1860 shows that the
bodily relationship or sexual intercourse by a husband with his second wife falls under
the category of offence under sections 493 and 495 of IPC, 1860 and it cannot be
treated as rape as defined in section 375 of IPC, 1860.41.
