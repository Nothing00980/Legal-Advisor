Sense of expression once explained.
Every expression which is explained in any part of this Code is used in every part of
this Code in conformity with the explanation.
COMMENTâ€”
Section 7 of IPC, 1860 provides that 'every expression' which is explained in any part of
the Code, is used in every part of the Code in conformity with the explanation. Let it be
noted that unlike the modern statute, section 7 does not provide 'unless the context
otherwise indicate' a phrase that prefaces the dictionary clauses of a modern statute.
Therefore, the expression 'Government' in section 21(12)(a) must mean either the
Central Government or the Government of a State.6.
