Punishment of offences committed beyond, but which by law may be tried
within India.
Any person liable, by any 36.[Indian law], to be tried for an offence committed beyond
37.[India] shall be dealt with according to the provisions of this Code for any act
committed beyond India in the same manner as if such act had been committed
within 38.[India].
COMMENTâ€”
This section and section 4 relate to the extraterritorial operation of the Code. The
words of this section postulate the existence of a law that an act constituting an
offence in India shall also be an offence when committed outside India. Thus, taking
part in a marriage which is prohibited by the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 by a
citizen of India beyond India is not an offence which can be punished in India.39. This
section only applies to the case of a person who at the time of committing the offence
charged was amenable to an Indian Court.40. Thus, an Indian citizen who committed an
offence outside India which was not an offence according to the laws of that country
would still be liable to be tried in India if it was an offence under the Indian law.41. An
Indian citizen was murdered by another Indian citizen in a foreign country and the
police refused to register an FIR on the ground that the offence was committed outside
India. The Court held that the refusal was illegal and directed the police to register the
crime and proceed with investigation in accordance with the law. The Court observed
that section 3 of the IPC, 1860 helps the authorities in India to proceed by treating the
offence as one committed within India. No doubt it is by a fiction that such an
assumption is made. But such an assumption was necessary for practical purposes.42.
In a series of cases43. it was also held that an offence committed outside India by a
citizen of India can be investigated by the local police even without prior sanction of
the Central Government. Where both husband and wife are Indians residing at USA, a
complaint against the husband alleging cruelty is maintainable.44.
The operation of the section is restricted to the cases specified in the Extradition Act,
1962 and the Cr PC, 1973, sections 188 and 189.
