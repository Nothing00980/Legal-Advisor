Mischief by injury to works of irrigation or by wrongfully diverting
water.
Whoever commits mischief by doing any act which causes, or which he knows to be
likely to cause, a diminution of the supply of water for agricultural purposes, or for
food or drink for human beings or for animals which are property, or for cleanliness or
for carrying on any manufacture, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both.
COMMENTâ€”
This section deals with diminution of water supply, e.g., the placing of an embankment
across a channel. Section 277 applies if the water is fouled so as to be unfit for use.
This section applies equally to irrigation channels as to other sources of irrigation, such
as tanks and ponds.
For a conviction under this section, there must be some infringement of right resting in
some one by the act of the accused.641.
