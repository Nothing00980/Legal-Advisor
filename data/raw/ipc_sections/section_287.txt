COMMENT.â€”
Under the second part of this section, a person in possession of a poisonous
substance should have negligently omitted to take such order with it as is sufficient to
guard against any probable danger to human life from such substance. It is not
necessary that the negligent omission should be followed by any disastrous
consequences.85.
