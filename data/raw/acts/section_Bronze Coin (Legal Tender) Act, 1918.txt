Act 
22 of 1918

Object and Reasons.- It is of importance to enable the Indian Mints to  increase the rate of output of rupees from the large supply which the Government of India are at present obtaining. One method of effecting this is to arrange for  the coinage elsewhere of the bonze coinage which is at  present carried out by the Calcutta Mint. An arrangement has accordingly been entered into with His Exalted  Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad for the coinage, for  the present, at the Hyderabad Mint of bronze pice or  quarter-anna pieces. In order to make the pice so coined  legal tender, within British India, legislation is required  since under Section 14 of the Indian Coinage Act. 1906  (III of 1906), read with Section 8 thereof only pice coined  at Mints established under the Indian Coinage Act are legal tender within British India. It is accordingly proposed by the present Bill that where the bronze coinage  specified in the Indian Coinage Act are coined outside  British India at the request of the Governor-General in  Council, and the Governor-General in Council is satisfied that such coins are in accordance with the requirements of the Act and of any notification for the time being in force thereunder, he may by notification in the  Gazette of India. direct the issue of any such coins, and  these shall thereafter be legal tender in the same manner  as if they had been coined under the provisions of the  Indian Coinage Act. - Gazette of India, 1918.
