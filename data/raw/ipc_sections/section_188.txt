Illegal purchase or bid for property offered for sale by authority of
public servant.
Whoever, at any sale of property1 held by the lawful authority of a public servant, as
such, purchases or bids for any property on account of any person, whether himself or
any other, whom he knows to be under a legal incapacity to purchase that property at
that sale, or bids for such property not intending to perform the obligations under
which he lays himself by such bidding, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to one month, or with fine which may extend
to two hundred rupees, or with both.
COMMENT—
This section makes it penal to bid at a public sale of property on account of a party
who is under a legal incapacity to purchase it, or to bid for it not intending to complete
the purchase or as it is expressed to perform the obligations under which the bidder
lays himself by such "bidding".98.
1. 'Property'.—This word is used in its wide sense. The right to sell drugs is a monopoly
granted for a certain area and comes within the definition of property. A person who
bids at an auction of the right to sell drugs within a certain area under a false name
and, when the sale is confirmed in his favour, denies that he has ever made any bid at
all, is guilty of an offence under this section.99.
