Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt.
Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 335, voluntarily causes grievous
hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.
COMMENT.—
This section prescribes the punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt except in
cases provided for by section 335. The facts involved in a particular case, depending
upon various factors like size, sharpness, would throw light on the question whether
the weapon was a dangerous or deadly weapon or not. That would determine whether
in the case section 325 or section 326 would be applicable. Considering the size of the
stone which was used, as revealed by material on record, it cannot be said that a
dangerous weapon was used. Therefore, the conviction was altered to section 325 IPC,
1860.793. Where a player in a friendly cricket match blew a stump against another
player which hit his head and caused death, it was held that the intention to cause
death or likelihood of it being not proved, an offence under section 325 was made out,
injury having been caused by a blunt weapon.794. Where medical evidence showed that
attack on the forehead of the deceased was by a lathi and the internal injury could not
be correlated to the external injury caused by the accused, it was held that the accused
was liable under section 325 IPC, 1860 and not under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860.795.
Where two injuries were caused in a quarrel by the two accused persons each of whom
inflicted one stick blow one of which proved fatal but it could not be known who had
inflicted that blow and since intention to cause death was not established, conviction
was altered from under section 302 to section 325 read with section 34.796. In a fight
between two groups, one person received one stick blow on the head and died a week
after treatment and operation. It could not be said that the accused had knowledge that
blow would cause death of that person. Conviction of the accused under section 304
Part II/34 was altered to one under sections 325 and 34.797. In an altercation between
father and the son, the son gave a blow on the head of his father with a heavy stick and
ran away. The victim died after one week in the hospital. It was held that the attack was
not pre-meditated and the offence fell under section 325 and not under section 302.798.
In a case the victim had sustained a grievous injury on a vital portion of the body and
the injury was life threatening, imposition of sentence of six days only, which was the
period already undergone by the accused in confinement was held too lenient.
However, as the parties had forgotten their differences and were living peacefully for 25
years, the Court taking into consideration the aggravating as well as mitigating factors
under the facts of this case, imposed a sentence of six months' rigorous imprisonment
and a fine of Rs. 25,000/- against the accused.799. In a clash over property dispute the
accused party caused grievous injuries to two persons and simple injuries to some
others. The occurrence took place 17 years before and some of the accused were more
than 76 years of age and one of them had died. Their conviction under section 325 was
affirmed but the sentence was reduced to the period already undergone as the Court
did not think it fit to send them back to jail. However, a fine of Rs. 200 was imposed on
each one of them.800. In this connection, see also discussion and cases under sub-
heads "Death caused without requisite 'intention or knowledge' not culpable homicide"
and "single blow or lathi blow" under section 299, ante.801.
[s 325.1] Sentence.—
Once the accused is held guilty of commission of offence punishable under section
325 IPC, 1860 then imposition of jail sentence and fine on the accused is mandatory.
So far as jail sentence is concerned, it may extend up to 7 years as per court's
discretion whereas so far as fine amount is concerned, its quantum would also depend
upon the Court's discretion.802. Where the victim sustained a grievous injury on a vital
portion of the body, i.e., the head, which was fractured and the injury was life
threatening, imposition of the sentence of six days only which was the period already
undergone by the accused in confinement was held too lenient. The Supreme Court
considering the aggravating as well as mitigating factors under the facts that the
parties have forgotten their differences and are living peacefully imposed a sentence of
6 months' RI and a fine of Rs. 25,000/- against the accused.803.
[s 325.2] Compounding of offence under sections 323 and 325.—
During the pendency of proceedings under these sections, the parties effected a
compromise at the instance of their elders. Parties belonged to the same family and
there was no previous enmity. Permission to compound the offence under section 325
was granted by the High Court.804.

hostility towards the accused. Conviction was under section 325 and not section 307. The
accused was a young rustic villager, uneducated but no criminal background, nine years had
lapsed since the incident. Sentence of two years for grevious hurt and two years for extortion
