The Guardians And Wards Act, 1890
(8 of 1890)
Last Updated 30th December, 2019
Statement of Objects and Reasons.-This Bill to consolidate and amend the law relating to Guardians and Wards is based on opinions elicited by a reference to Local Governments and High Courts on the subject of certain defects in the law relating to the guardianship of minors, and its object is to provide a law of Guardian and Ward applicable as far as possible to all classes of Her Majesty's subjects in British India.
Among the enactments which the Bill will supersede are Act 40 of 1858 and portions of the Madras Code, relating to minors in the Presidencies of Bengal and Madras who are not European British subjects and are not under the superintendence of a Court of Wards Act 20 of 1864, relating to minors in the Presidency of Bombay who are not European British subjects; Act 9 of 1861, relating to the custody and guardianship of minors who are not European British subjects; and Act 13 of 1874, relating to the guardianship of European British minors in territories beyond the jurisdiction of the Chartered High Courts.
The Bill, which follows generally the frame of Act 13 of 1874, is drawn as applicable to all District Courts and High Courts (including the Chartered High Courts) and to minors of all creeds and races. But it does not take away any of the powers at present possessed by the Chartered High Courts, and it provides that, in the selection of guardians and other matters, regard shall be had to the personal law of the minor. The jurisdiction and authority of the Courts of Wards are expressly saved and will not be in any way affected by the proposed law.
One effect of the assimilation of the law will be to do away with the rule, which obtains in the Presidencies of Bengal and Bombay, that no person shall be entitled to institute or defend any suit connected with a minor's estate of which he claims the charge until he has obtained a certificate of administration. It is proposed that suits by and against minors shall be regulated by Chapter XXXI of the Code of Civil Procedure' and that, in a Bill which is to be introduced to amend that Code, provision be inserted conferring, among other privileges, on a guardian who has been appointed, or whose title has been declared, under the Guardians and Wards law, a preferential right to be appointed next friend or guardian for the suit.'
Acts 40 of 1858 and 20 of 1864 provide, in sections 27 and 31, respectively, that nothing in those Acts shall authorise the appointment of any person other than a female as the guardian of the person of a female. The cases reported at I.L.R. 10 Cal. 15 and I.L.R. 11 Cal. 574, and the remarks at pages 213-14 of Sayyid Amir Ali's Personal Law of Muhammadans, seem to render the re-enactment of the provision inexpedient. Section 15 of the Bill specifies the matters by which the Court is to be guided in appointing a guardian, and one of those matters is the law to which the minor is subject.
The provision of Act 20 of 1864, that the legal heir of a minor, or the person next in succession to his property, may not be appointed guardian of the person of the minor, has not been repeated. It is considered that the appointment of such persons should not be absolutely prohibited. This was the opinion of the Supreme Council when Act 40 of 1858 was about to be enacted (Proceedings of Legislative Council, 1858, pages 576-77) and is the opinion of the Hon'ble Mr. Melvill.
If the Bill becomes law in its present form, Article 10 of Schedule I of the Court-fees Act, 1870, which applies only to the Presidencies of Bengal and Bombay, will become obsolete. It has, therefore, been included in the schedule of enactments to be repealed.

21.
 Capacity of minors to act as guardians

23.

[Now see Section 97, Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (2 of 1974).]

(3)
The Court may in its discretion attach to the permission the following among other conditions, namely:
(a)
that a sale shall not be completed without the sanction of the Court;
(b)
that a sale shall be made to the highest bidder by public auction, before the Court or some person specially appointed by the Court for that purpose, at a time and place to be specified by the Court, after such proclamation of the intended sale as the Court, subject to any rules made under this Act by the High Court, directs;

32.
 Variation of powers of guardian of property appointed or declared by the Court


.Where a guardian of the property of a ward has been appointed or declared by the Court and such guardian is not the Collector, the Court may, from time to time, by order, define, restrict or extend his powers with respect to the property of the ward in such manner and to such extent as it may consider to be for the advantage of the ward and consistent with the law to which the ward is subject.
33.
 Right of guardian so appointed or declared to apply to the Court for opinion in management of property of ward
