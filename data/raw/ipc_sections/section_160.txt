Assaulting or obstructing public servant when suppressing riot, etc.
Whoever assaults or threatens to assault, or obstructs or attempts to obstruct, any
public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant, in endeavouring to
disperse an unlawful assembly, or to suppress a riot or affray, or uses, or threatens, or
attempts to use criminal force to such public servant, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with
fine, or with both.
COMMENT—
Assault or obstruction of public servant.—The last section punished disobedience to
the order of a public servant commanding an assembly to disperse. This section
punishes more severely persons who assault a public servant endeavouring to disperse
an unlawful assembly. It is intended to prevent the use of force on a public servant in
order to prevent him from discharging his duty.
