Harbouring persons hired for an unlawful assembly.
Whoever harbours, receives or assembles, in any house or premises in his occupation
or charge, or under his control any persons, knowing that such persons have been
hired, engaged, or employed, or are about to be hired, engaged, or employed, to join or
become members of an unlawful assembly, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with
both.
COMMENT—
Harbouring hired persons.—Section 150 makes the hiring of persons to join an
unlawful assembly punishable, whereas this section makes punishable the harbouring
of such hired persons. It has a wider application.
The section clearly refers to some unlawful assembly in the future and provides for an
occurrence which may happen, not which has happened. An act of harbouring a
person, with the knowledge that, in some time past, he had joined or was likely to have
been a member of an unlawful assembly, is not an offence under this section.216.
