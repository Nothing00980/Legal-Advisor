Wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement, kidnapped or
abducted person.
Whoever, knowing that any person has been kidnapped or has been abducted,
wrongfully conceals or confines such person, shall be punished in the same manner
as if he had kidnapped or abducted such person with the same intention or
knowledge, or for the same purpose as that with or for which he conceals or detains
such person in confinement.
COMMENT.—
This section does not apply to the principal offender but to those persons who assist
him in concealing a kidnapped or abducted person. It refers to some other party who
assists in concealing any person who has been kidnapped. A kidnapper cannot be
convicted under this section.1148. The other party who wrongfully conceals or confines
a kidnapped person knowing that he has been kidnapped suffers the same
consequences at par with the person who had kidnapped or abducted the person with
the same intention or knowledge or for the same purpose.1149. This is one of those
sections in which subsequent abetment is punished as a substantive offence.
[s 368.1] Ingredients.—
To constitute an offence under this section it is necessary to establish the following
ingredients:—
(1) The person in question has been kidnapped.
(2) The accused knew that the said person had been kidnapped.
(3) The accused having such knowledge wrongfully conceals or confines the
person concerned.
Apart from direct evidence these ingredients can be proved by facts and circumstances
of a particular case.1150. Where the complicity of the accused in selling the wife of the
co-accused was established and the buyer raped and killed her, a conviction under this
section was upheld by the Supreme Court.1151. Three accused persons were charged
of the offence of kidnapping a child but the child was recovered from the custody of
another person who was a relative of the three accused persons. They were acquitted.
It was held that the other person could not be convicted under section 368 unless it
was proved that the person from whose custody the child was recovered had
knowledge of the fact that the child was a kidnapped child.1152.
