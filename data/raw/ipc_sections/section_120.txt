Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for
act done.
If the act for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed
in addition to the act abetted, and constitutes a distinct offence, the abettor is liable
to punishment for each of the offences.
ILLUSTRATION
A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence,
resists that distress. In offering the resistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the
officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offences of resisting the
distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment
for both these offences; and, if A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous
hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the
offences.
COMMENTS.â€”
This section extends the principle enunciated in the preceding section. Under it the
abettor is punished for the offence abetted as well as the offence committed. A joint
reading of sections 111, 112 and 133 make it abundantly clear that if a person abets
another in the commission of an offence and the principal goes further thereafter and
does something more which has a different result from that intended by the abettor
and makes the offence an aggravated one, the abettor is liable for the consequences of
the acts of his principal. The crux of the problem in an enquiry of this sort is whether
the abettor as reasonable man at the time of his instigation or intentionally aiding the
principal would have foreseen the probable consequences of his abetment.96.
